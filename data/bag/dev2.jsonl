Its all a game of illusion in ones mind. It goes like this, if i want to be someone, i train myself to be someone, but then i forget that pretending to be someone makes people fail to see the real me. The simple solution as you might assume is to be truely oneself, well unfortunately the story doesn't end there. I mean its really good for everyone to be or potray truely what they are but then we all are in our own ways of being very judgemental. It depends who can and who cannot stand against other's callous judgements. Anyways, the point i am really trying to emphasise here is that, when one doesn't like the way one is, he tries to achieve to be someone else but what happens is he ends up pretending forever even before he has reached his goal...which means that one lives in an illusion of oneself of how one wants to be seen and thats when people around him fail to see him and he himself fails to see the true him."}

PERFORMANCE ELEVATED\u2122. www.mountainhardwear.com &nbsp; Yesterday I had the great pleasure of joining 200 runners for the Caumsett State Park 50k in Lloyd Harbor, NY, put on by New York Ultra Running . As the USATF 50k Road Championships, lots of speed demons were out to enjoy one of the first sunny days to come after a long, hard northeast winter. What better way than a 10 lap loop course with fellow ultra warriors? As I warmed up with Team Inov-8 runner Ben Nephew , we agreed that the day had a lot the right ingredients for a breakthrough PR. Although the temp was in the high 30's, the sun would warm up the day to ideal low 50's by the halfway point. Short of some wind gusts, this was MUCH better than snow/sleet/sub-zero Caumsett 50k's of the past. Plus there were a lot of great runners here - 2x defending champ and course record holder (2:56) Michael Wardian , Scott Jaime (pronounced Hi-Me) from Colorado, 50k Masters American Record holder Dan Verrington , 24-hour American Record holder Mark Godale , 24-hour National Team member Phil McCarthy, Montrail runners Annette Bednosky and Jill Perry , the great Scott Jurek, and a half dozen more that could go sub-3:30 on a good day. I felt like a kid meeting my favorite rock stars! &nbsp; (Ben Nephew and I sport the new Team Inov-8 shirts) &nbsp; (Staying warm at the start) My personal goal for the day was to improve on my 50k PR (3:37 at the 2009 Ruth Anderson 50k ). My speed work was going INSANELY well over the last three months, particularly by teaching me that I could be in a lot of pain and still hold my form. To achieve a PR, like any stretch goal, you need three things. First, you need to show up (check). I know that sounds simple, but as we all know, getting the start line healthy and ready can be tough. Second, you need the opportunity, like a day of perfect weather and runners faster than you (check). Third, you need to believe that it is possible to achieve something beyond your best (check, thank you speedwork). Let's DO THIS! At 8:30am, Suffolk County Legislator Jon Cooper sent off the 50k runners (30 minutes ahead of the 25k runners) and the front pack quickly spread out. Wardian, Jesse Regnier (in his first race beyond 8 miles), and 2:19 marathoner Malcolm Campbell went out hard, running 5:30 min/miles. Scott Jaime and Malcolm Campbell each ran solo at a sub-6 pace a few steps back, and Dan Verrington, Ben Nephew, Mark Godale and I clocked 6 min./miles in the next chase pack. Dan was doing most of the work in our pack, letting us know right up front that he was shooting for \"3 and low teens since the 45-49 50k American Record is soft at 3:17\". I guess he would know - it's his record! We finished the first lap in 18 minutes. My God, this was fast. &nbsp; (Mark Godale, Ben Nephew, and Dan Verrington chasing Scott Jaime) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Michael Wardian and Jesse Raginer finish up lap #1) We got sight of the Womens race on the out and back section, and front runners Annette Bednosky, Jill Perry, and Yolanda Flamino were sticking close to each other. Last years champ and course record holder, Kami Semick, was not present today so it was anyone's race. They were all keeping each other in sight. &nbsp; (Jill Perry leads Annette Bednosky and Yolanda Flamino) Ben Nephew was nice enough to help pace the pack with Dan, but around lap 3 (mile 9) Dan picked up the pace charging the uphill grades and dropped us. Mark Godale fell off the pace, and Ben and I speculated that he probably wasn't in peak shape thanks to daughter #3 recently arriving. We both had 3-year-olds and knew how that could crimp a training plan, but #3? Fuggetaboutit. &nbsp; (Scott Jaime gives a thumbs up) On each subsequent lap, we molted layers of hats, gloves, sleeves, wool, etc. until we were down to our tank tops in the 45-degree air. Ben continued to do the lion's share of the pacing, running with a short and powerful stride from all his snowshoeing. I was nursing a sore shoulder from a sex-related injury (best if I don't provide detail on that one, but let me recommend that you stretch out before ANY strenuous exercise), but otherwise feeling strong. The aid station volunteers at both stops were amazing, and we barely had to slow for whatever we needed. On lap 6 (mile 18), my body demanded a bio break and I made a absurdly efficient 20-second stop at the port-a-potty. Ben wished me well, and from that point on he would be little more than a dot on the horizon. That was okay though - I knew the last third was going to be a three-night stay in the House of Pain, and it felt proper to venture into that valley of darkness alone. &nbsp;(Local ultrarunners not obeying the speed limit) I wasn't alone, however, since thanks to the loop format I got to see EVERYONE. The New York Ultra Runners were having a great day and making the most of the early signs of Spring. I exchanged atta-boys with 78-year-old Sam Soccoli from North Babylon, NY, and the famous Roy Pirrung who was defying his 62-year-old age with a sub-5 hour pace. 70-old Patricia Delaney was also making good time, and always had a smile on. They sure breed 'em tough out here! At Lap 8, I hit the marathon mark in 2:48 (almost a PR!) and fought desperately to hold my form. Michael Wardian gave a few words of encouragement as he lapped me, slowing but still on course record pace. At the turnaround, I could see that Dan Verrington had passed Scott Jaime, but Scott was keeping him in sight. Ben was still holding on strong and was about a minute ahead of me now. The Womens race found Yolanda Flamino in front after dropping the hammer on lap 3 and gapping the other women by a good 15 minutes. Annette Bednosky, however, was picking up speed in one of her classic negative split finishes. &nbsp; (Ben Nephew keeps cranking) As I entered Lap 10, my stomach knotted up, my head started spinning, and my muscles began twitching like crazy. My pace had slowed to a 7 minute mile as I walked the two aid stations to try and get more liquids in. The pain. My God, the pain! I could feel my heartbeat in the back of my eyeballs. But as the mile markers reminded me, this was almost over. Annette was kind enough to pick up the pace and run along with me until the last 1/2 mile, and I gave it everything. I crossed the finish in 3:20:48, good enough for 6th overall. &nbsp;(Mark Godale and Dan Verrington talk about the race) I laughed out loud as I crossed the finish line. Did that just happen? Did I just take 17 minutes off my PR? Either the training is going well, or I have been seriously sandbagging for a long time now. As I spoke with the other finishers, it turns out many of them had breakthrough days. Michael Wardian (2:55) had beat his previous record by 40 seconds, with Malcolm Campbell (3:04) getting second with a great performance. Scott Jaime (3:13) had passed Dan Verrington (3:15) to claim third and the Masters win, but Dan set a new 45-49 age group American Record in the process. Ben was quite pleased with his 3:18 best on this course, and Mark Godale charged in the last laps to finish a few minutes behind me. Jesse Raginer clocked a 3:28 in his first 50k - not bad at all! &nbsp;(2010 Womens 50k Road National Champion, Yolanda Flamino) (Scott Jaime gets the Masters payday from RD Amy Goldstein) Yolanda Flamino won the Womens division in 3:34, with Annette Bednosky (3:43) taking second and winning the Masters division in a time well under her goal. Jill Perry (3:47) fought through some tough spots to hold onto third. ( full results ) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Scott Jurek, me, and 2010 50k Road National Champion, Michael Wardian) &nbsp; (Sporting the hardware with 3rd place Womens finisher Jill Perry) I felt like an Olympian with all my medals (a gorgeous finisher medal, a USATF medal for 6th overall and a USATF medal for 2nd in 40-44), and was tickled to get the $50 check for third Master. Paydays are rare in this sport! My thanks to RD Amy Goldstein, her wonderful volunteers and sponsors, Howard Nippert and the crew at USATF, and the nice folks of Long Island for putting on a great race. Thanks to the opportunity, assistance, and support you provided, I had a breakthrough day! &nbsp; (Schwag overload! I'm in heaven...) Michele Wallace from the San Diego News wrote a fun article about Mike and Kim Rouse, a couple who (somehow) gets along while training for ultras, Ironmans, and even the Ultraman. I love their quotes about each other - it's truly a match made in heaven! You can read the whole article here . &nbsp; (Photo courtesy of poet Ollie Lind ) Have you ever noticed that half of the stories in endurance magazines sound like Mad Libs for people in recovery? Sometimes I swear they just plug in the facts: \" [Name] got into running after recovering from [near-fatal disease or accident] just [random number] years ago. \"I was in bed, feeling sorry for myself, [another random number] pounds overweight, and my [body part] looked like [bad food or construction analogy] . I decided the best way to beat [near-fatal disease or accident] was to celebrate the health I had one day at a time. I trained for months and completed [major race] . I'm not embarrassed about my [body part] since it gives me a chance to educate others about [near-fatal disease or accident] . I've now hooked up with [charity of near-fatal disease or accident] to run more, and hope to inspire others with [near-fatal disease or accident] and be living proof it is possible to overcome.\" Unfortunately it's easy to gloss over the message in these formulaic summaries. In truth, there is something very powerful at the heart of these tales. This is Part II of my long run revelations: \"To lead a fulfilled life, embrace death.\" I've had the good fortune of losing some friends and family in the last six months. I know that sounds backwards, since the pain and loss that immediately accompanies such devastation is soul-crushing. But by embracing loss and authentically internalizing the myriad of feelings that surround it, life feels more precious. Life IS more precious. If we are living, we are survivors. We should all embrace life as fully as our formulaic heroes. It's such a shame that most of us can easily avoid our own finality in day-to-day routine, distracting media, and pharmacologically-enhanced lives. Comfort is good, and probably necessary for some level of sanity, but it's important to regularly remind yourself not to take it all for granted. I often feel this is the reason many of us enter endurance events and push our personal limits - we surround ourselves in pain and adventure so thick that we can't escape asking ourselves the very basic questions of what makes us happy, what makes us tick, and what gives life meaning. Through the pain, we grow, and for days afterward, we cherish every breath, every sunset, and every laugh. At the 2009 Western States, I got so deep it got scary . But the serenity that followed lasted for weeks, even months, and was nothing short of life-changing. If 27+ hours on the trail is all it takes to reach that level of enlightenment and peace, it may very well have been the easiest thing I have ever done. Embrace your finality. Treasure the moments you have. See life in its fullest hue. It's the best way to honor those who left before you, and makes for MUCH better stories. - SD [You can also read Long Run Revelations, Part I - There Is No Such Thing As Work/Life Balance, Only Life Balance ] I've recently seen a large increase in traffic to this blog from blogger.com, meaning more and more bloggers are following me. Great to have you! Just in case it's helpful, I thought I would share a few tips picked up from analyzing traffic over the last few months. We all have different goals for blogging, and it's totally fine if you don't ever analyze your traffic or try to boost your readership. But I will say once you start looking into it, you will be surprised how many people are connecting to your insights. Here a few quick and simple ways to boost your traffic: 1) Use an analytics service . Wonder how I knew about the increase in traffic from blogger.com? My analytics service helped me track it. If you aren't using one, I would suggest you do. Most of these services are free - StatCounter and Google Analytics being two of my favorites - and will start giving you fascinating data immediately after you add a few lines of code to your template or add a widget. Imagine being able to see who sends the most traffic, which search words bring people to your site, and how folks navigate your blog. This week my top referral sites were run100s.com (Stan Jensen's encyclopedic site on ultrarunning), wikipedia (largely on Dean Karnazes inquiries), and forum.somethingawful.com (from a forum conversation that linked to toenail removal), and my top search terms were \"caballo blanco\", \"coconut water\", and \"cross country championships\". It's a fascinating time suck. ;-) Once you get some analytics, a few of these other suggestions will make sense. 2) Add the LinkWithin widget . If you look at the bottom of my blog entry, you'll see a thing that suggests other blog posts you might like. That's LinkWithin , and it's a very simple free widget to add. On average, it has increased my traffic 18% without having to do a thing. But more importantly, it helps convert a lot of first time visitors into reading 2-3 pages. Odds are a few of them will be more regular readers. 3) Bring on the pics ! Behind Google, my #2 contributor of traffic is images.google.com. This is from people looking for pictures of trail running, parks, people, etc., and has continuously been one of the big attractors of new readers to my blog. You can help Google figure out what your pictures are about with some clever image naming, such as \"2009_xterra_trail_running_world_championship_hawaii_max_king_winning.jpg\". Think about how many image searches might hit that - xterra, max king, hawaii trail running, etc. - especially over time. I've found a direct correlation to the number of pictures in a blog entry, and the number of visitors over time. Basically you can't ever have too many and if you name the images correctly, they will pull readers in for years to come. On the flip side, I recently tried out \"Snapshots\", a widget that popped up a pre-link window that did not do much for traffic so I turned it off. I've also added \"recent comments\" on the right, but haven't seen a noticeable change in traffic. But I find it useful, so I will leave it up a bit longer. Got a great tip? Let me hear it! It's how we all get better. Thx, SD Olympians and all-around running superstars Dathan Ritzenheim and Shalane Flanagan dominated the USA Cross Country Championships in Spokane, WA, this weekend.

If I were you, I'd try Comtan (slows down the breakdown of dopamine) and one of the dopamine agonists (I take Mirapex, tried Requip but it made me sick). Even though your neurolgist won't like this (If he won't do it, get him to prescribe Sinemet too, and just don't take it), beleive me, you will progress a lot more slowly!"}

{"id": "bag-2354", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "A recent article gave an interesting look into exorcism as practiced within the Roman Catholic Church. According to Father Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican's chief exorcist, the unfortunate sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church is proof that \"the Devil is at work inside the Vatican.\" Astonishingly, Father Amorth indicated that he participated in around 70,000 exorcisms during his 25 years as a Catholic exorcist. For any of you who are counting, that's a claim of approximately 7.5 exorcisms per day, for the last 25 years!\n\nWhile Father Amorth's description of satanic possession seems quite graphic, from at least one personal experience I can affirm that a good portion of it is fairly accurate. I previously wrote about Satan's power and influence in a related post.\n\nWithout delving into the controversial sex abuse scandals or trying to figure out how Father Amorth has time to sleep or eat with his busy exorcist schedule, I'd like to discuss priesthood authority and its connection to rejecting satanic presence. Particularly, is Christ's true priesthood required to command Satan and his subjects? Can the faith of an individual (or the combined faith of those present) be used in an exorcism instead of invoking or wielding the true priesthood authority?\n\nThe apostle John once remarked to the Savior that \"[the apostles] saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us\" (Luke 9:49-50)(emphasis added).\n\nDoes this mean that those without Christ's true priesthood authority are able to command and cast out devils as much as one with authority? Commenting on the phrase \"he followeth not us,\" Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote:\n\"He was not one of the Twelve to whom the express power had been given to cast out devils (Matthew 10:8); he was not one of the inner circle of disciples who traveled, ate, slept, and communed with the Master. Luke has it: 'He followeth not with us'; that is, he is not one of our traveling companions. But from our Lord's reply it is evident that he was a member of the kingdom, a legal administrator who was acting in the authority of the priesthood and the power of faith. Either he was unknown to John who therefore erroneously supposed him to be without authority or else John falsely supposed that the power to cast out devils was limited to the Twelve and did not extend to all faithful priesthood holders. It is quite possible that the one casting out devils was a seventy.\n...\n\"Only righteous men who are members of the Church, who hold the priesthood, and who are keeping the commandments, have power to perform miracles.... Our Lord had many faithful followers who had power by faith to cast out devils\" (Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, 1:417)(emphasis added).\n\nTo be clear, I do not believe the Catholic Church wields the true priesthood of God. Consistent with LDS theology, I believe Christ's true priesthood was lost to the world at large during the great apostasy. However, I also do not believe that Catholic exorcists, such as Father Amorth are followers of Satan. (See Matt. 12:25-26) Notwithstanding, is it possible that exorcisms can still be effectuated by individuals lacking the priesthood through an exercise and display of faith?\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith taught that \"faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth\" (Lectures on Faith, 1:13)(emphasis added). Indeed, it was faith that was invoked to frame the worlds (Heb 11:3), and it is through faith that all created things exist. \"[Faith] is the principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all temporal as well as eternal things.... And if the principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in Diety\" (Id. at 1:16, 18)(emphasis added).\n\nWhen the Twelve were unable to cast a devil out of a \"lunatick,\" they queried the Savior on how He was able to finish what they could not. Christ then proceeded to teach them doctrines of faith, not of priesthoods. \"Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting\" (Matt. 17:20-21)(emphasis added). Thus, since prayer and fasting doesn't have any effect on whether one possesses the priesthood but instead affects one's level of faith, it appears that exorcism relies more on the principle of faith than on one's authority.\n\nAdmittedly, I have not taken part in or seen a Catholic exorcism (apart from what Hollywood concocts). I have, however, taken part in a handful of LDS exorcisms and can attest that one's faith plays an enormous role. Still, I am not certain of the extent that God's priesthood plays in such instances. Is the pristhood required simply to keep order? Yet, if an individual lacks the priesthood but has sufficient faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, can that individual command evil in His name? And, if that is the case, does Father Amorth truly exorcise evil spirits during his claimed frequent encounters?"}

{"id": "bag-2802", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "I was going over what I was writing about the bullpen when compared with last season, and unfortunately I don't think I can make a comparison until Opening Day. I have no idea, outside of the mainstays (K-Rod, Feliciano, Parnell), who will be on the roster. The short summary is that I was pumped for the 8-9 combo of Putz and K-Rod last season, bullpens are notoriously unpredictable year to year, and Ambiorix Burgos may have killed someone with his car. As of now, I'm not even all that certain who the fifth starter will be. The team seems intent on having that be either Niese or Nieve, but neither is pitching like they want the job (at least not when compared to Misch and Figueroa). So, my bullpen summary will be postponed until next month, when I have a clue as to the composition. That being said, there are some position battles that the organization are ignoring because they arose out of injury. Shortstop: Jose Reyes and his overactive thyroid has opened an every day job for Alex Cora. Cora is a known commodity, which is one of my favorite backhanded compliments. I'm no expert with major league playing time and minor league options, but I'd like to see Tejada man the spot. He's hitting well enough right now, and I'm not sure how much that counts in Spring, but its better than not hitting at all. I'm not sure the Mets want to do that, but I think it's time we start looking at developing this kid, especially when I hear his defense and speed are major-league ready. Centerfield: Poor Gary Matthews, Jr. What am I saying? Rich Gary Matthews, Jr. Whatever you call him, he's the odd man out in the CF battle. The job looks like it will go to Pagan, who, if he realizes his upside, could be a known commodity. I know everyone will have terror flashbacks when they think of Fernando Martinez's cup of coffee last season, but he's tearing the cover off the ball now. Again, this is Spring Training, so it may not be worth much, but maybe he carries that over into the start of the season. I think Manuel should take a good look at F-Mart to start the season. I know these are temporary position battles, but I think that's all the more reason to go with youth. Let's get some young energy out there. Who knows when Beltran returns, and what the condition of his knee is? And with Reyes, I'm certainly no endocrinologist. Here\u2019s my problem with John Maine. I think we\u2019re all getting sick of his tired act. It\u2019s becoming the \u2018same ole story\u2019 with this guy. After following Johan Santana's 4-inning gem with a disaster, this is what he had to say: \"My mechanics felt fine...I just wasn't kind of that into it. It wasn't good. It's just I wasn't all that prepared. The feeling that it's not my game is the hardest thing. It's a waste of a day.\" What the fuck is this guy doing on the mound if he's just not that into it? And claiming to be unprepared when you know exactly when you are going to pitch? I don\u2019t get it, is it not your game because Johan Santana started it, it's Spring Training? Suck it up guy and pitch. Stop being a little bitch, that's what you get paid to do. Enough of the sappy follow ups, we don't give a shit, just get it done. Granted, there\u2019s a lot of Spring Training left, and that\u2019s great for John. He better use the time wisely to straighten himself out because I have news for John. If he comes out of the gate stumbling and struggling, his tired nice guy act is not going to fly for too long. He is now two years removed from his stellar 15-10 season, his only full season in the majors. So this season becomes very important for John to prove his worth. Our patience is thin to begin with and there are other guys chomping at the bit that have the ' cojones ' to take his place. Here are possible suitors ready to pounce on Maine's job. You have Hisanori Takahashi who is a veteran student of the game, can start and has been lights out. Jonathon Niese is in line for the 5 th starters' spot, if he doesn \u2019t win that job, he can steal Maine's. Nelson Figueroa, who no one is talking about, hasn \u2019t given up an earned run yet. Then there's Fernando Nieve and Jenrry Mejia. I don't think Nieve is the answer, and hopefully Mejia will start the year in the pen. But you catch my drift here, there are options if Maine sucks again. If not any of the above, Mets have stated that financially, they can take on more salary via a trade or what not. John Maine Just Isn't That Into You [NBC] Only the Mets\u2026unbelievable! Mets say Jose Reyes has an overactive thyroid. Jose Reyes is saying: \"Los especialistas que me atendieron en Nueva York me dijeron que estaba bien y que no tengo problemas de la tiroide\" \"Me dijeron que solamente ten\u00eda la garganta inflamada y no necesitaba medicinas para la tiroide u otra cosa\" \"La \u00fanica recomendaci\u00f3n de los especialistas fue que no comiera mariscos por la cantidad de yodo que contienen y que deb\u00eda chequearme cada tres semanas para ver como sigue todo\" Translation: \u201cThe specialists that attended me in New York told me that I\u2019m fine and that I don\u2019t have thyroid problems. They told me that I just had throat inflammation and that I don\u2019t need medication for thyroid or anything else. The only recommendation the specialists gave me is to not eat fish due to high iodine it contains and to get checked out every three weeks to see how things are going.\u201d Anyone see Jay Horowitz? Jay Horowitz anyone? Jay, are you there? What does this man get paid to do? Besides that good for nothing PR moron, you have to just scratch your head and say, \u201cWhat the fuck? Who\u2019s smoking crack here?\u201d It\u2019s got to be one of the following. Either Reyes is lying, or he didn\u2019t understand the doctors. Or are the Mets being overly stupidly cautious to lie due to them being scared shit that god forbid something happens to Reyes if he starts playing and this problem pops up again? See past. This is just getting stupid now. Maybe fathead Jay Horowitz will make an appearance. Diagn\u00f3stico diferente de Reyes y Mets [ESPN Deportes] Welcome to \"In Memoriam.\" A segment where we take a moment to celebrate, castigate, and otherwise reminisce on former Mets both good and evil. This edition: The Kid, Gary Carter, and his outrageous new Twitter feed! It wasn\u2019t too long ago when Gary Carter went a little looney on us. Early in 2008, with Willie Randolph on the chopping block, Carter sounded off with a 'pick me I'm available' public pitch to manage the Mets. \"I just want them to know of my availability. I'm only a phone call away because my contract allows me to leave the ballclub. I could be in New York tomorrow, if necessary, because if there's anything at the major league level I can leave this job.\" Carter, being the manager of the Orange County Flyers of the Independent Golden League in California at the time, of course recanted after the firestorm he created. \"I want to clear this up especially...I never wanted to try to undermine or do anything to bring this to a situation where I'm trying to campaign for something...I would love to get back to the big leagues as a coach, possibly a manager. I would love that opportunity. [But] I wish Willie well.\" Interestingly enough, he also did this in 2004 when Art Howe was taking up space in the dugout. But hold on to your shorts, the Kid is back and rawer than ever on his new Twitter feed - Gary Carter Raw . We've heard about athletes, celebrities, and even the president taking to Twitter. Here comes Gary Carter, spewing outrageous thoughts on everything from fucking single moms, Dykstra and the bathroom blow jobs, to Kevin Mitchell being a snitch, and everything in between. Here's a taste: \"Dave Magaden was lactose intolerant. But that didn't stop him from fucking Long Island cows on the daily\" On centerfielder-turned-Bernie-Madoff-accompice Lenny Dystra: \"When clubs got boring, we'd tell bouncers a homo kid with a mullet was offering BJ's in the mens room. They'd grab Dykstra, he'd fight back\" On current Angels manager Mike Sciocia: \"Little known fact...the retard in the movie \"leaving las Vegas\" that rapes Elizabeth Shue in the ass was Mike Scioscia, and he was not acting\" Dropping a dime on former teammates: \"Sid Fernandez and I coached a little league team in crown heights just to fuck single moms\" \"Its no surprise Kevin Mitchell left the team... he was a fucking snitch\" \"I caught Matt Williams jerking off while listening to Sinbads comedy tape on his walkman. Weird thing was I caught him in Will Clark's trunk\" \"Steve Sax seat on the bench was warmer than Robin Yount's wife's beard!\" \"I did a short stint as a \"Coyote\" south of the border...I still technically own Rafael Santana and his family\" Need we say more? This is truly a must-follow for Mets fans on Twitter (twitter.com/GaryCarterRaw). Gary, you are a fucking genius, please continue to entertain us. Carter apologizes for comments saying he wanted Mets' job [MLB] Lizzie Grubman and her Power Girls would have never let this happen. In fact, had they done the job, there would not be any complaints about the abstructed view seats at Citi Field. They would have the skill to convince fans that obstructed seats are the new wave and that you aren't anyone unless you had an obstructed seat. So in Citi Field's inagural season, the Mets, instead of letting fans know that the seats they were buying were somewhat obstructed, they hit the airwaves with a retarded statement. I'm still trying to decipher what this means. In a truly bizarre appearance on WFAN, team executive David Howard told fans that they didn't understand the nature of obstructed views because these seats merely had blind spots that meant you weren't able to see the entire field. Huh? It was just one more example of a team battling poor PR with even worse PR. Just as they refused to admit any mistakes with the medical staff or front office employees challenging minor leaguers to fights, they refused to admit that they made a mistake by not telling customers the whole story. Now there will be a warning for fans buying obstructed view seats. Are we seeing a change in PR policy? I doubt it as long as the current PR staff is in place. Warning reads: View: Limited portions of the playing field may not be visible from this seat location. Mets Stop Being Obstructionist About Stadium Obstructions [NBC] As I indicated last week, there is a reasonable expectation that the pitching will improve this season when compared to 2009. However, there are several reasons to expect that improvement to be marginal (though I expect it to be significant). The offense, on the hand, is another matter... Following is the projected lineup comparison (once Beltran returns from knee surgery). 2009 Opening Day Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Daniel Murphy - LF 3. Carlos Delgado - 1B 4. Carlos Beltran - CF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Ryan Church - RF 7. Brian Schneider - C 8. Luis Castillo - 2B 2010 Projected Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Luis Castillo - 2B 3. Carlos Beltran - CF 4. Jason Bay - LF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Jeff Francoeur - RF 7. Daniel Murphy - 1B 8. Rod Barajas - C Let's go by order in the lineup and see what improvements we can expect from this year's team. 1. Obviously, we need more than the 36 games we got last year from Reyes. Oddly, he may start the season in the three slot (this is more apparent after yesterday's Spring Training game), which has arguable merit. The leadoff spot was manned best in Reyes' absence by Angel Pagan until he got hurt. Pagan is my odds-on favorite to win the CF job and get the leadoff slot should Manuel decide to bat Reyes third until Beltran returns. Assuming one month of Pagan and the rest of the season with Reyes, this slot can't help but be a significant improvement over last year. 2. Murph was overhyped coming out of Spring last season. Also, the sky is blue, the President is Black, and Elmer Fudd has problems with the letter \"R\". On the opposite end, I don't know that we could have expected any less from Castillo. I'd take a repeat of last year from Castillo as the perfect no. 2 slot season (and word is, he's lost more weight and is in better shape this year). 3. Carlos Delgado just had hip surgery - no, not that surgery, this is a new one. I'm sad for him, in part because I thought we could take a late flyer on him with an incentive-laden deal and he could wrestle the job from Murph. Before he got hurt, he was the only guy hitting moon shots to right at Citi Cavern. I think we've seen the last of Delgado, in any uniform. Odds are we'll see Reyes for a month in this slot and then Beltran for the balance of the season. Again, nowhere to go but up. 4. Bay jumps into a slot that was best manned last year by... wait for it... Gary Sheffield. Yes, that Gary Sheffield, who if he lands a job this Spring will have played in four different decades. Bay has his issues, and maybe the back end of this contract will be ugly, but for now he replaces what we thought we'd get from Delgado last year, but from the right side. He will certainly be an improvement over Murph in left and is a .380 OBP guy who slugs over .500 and plays every day. 5. Which David Wright will we get this year? The guy who had his worst season as a pro, or the all-star we had for the previous four seasons. I remember arguments about who you'd take first to start a team - Wright or Pujols (now that argument is Mauer or Pujols). Wright's anemic power may have been the result of little protection, adjustments to a new ballpark, girlfriend troubles, who knows... But, if you're so inclined, take a look at his numbers last year. Ignoring the low homerun total, it wasn't all that bad a year. In fact, it was a pretty good year (144 games, 80+ runs, 70+ rbis and a .390 OBP). Expect his slugging to improve some, Pujols to be caught on the juice and the argument to be Mauer vs. Wright. 6. This is the most underrated position upgrade on the team. Church was a AAAA player. Francoeur may not live up to the promise he showed in his early years as a Brave, but he has good pop, plays great defense in right (he has a sick cannon) and is a takes his lunchpail kind of guy. I wish he'd learn to take a walk, but if you look at his numbers as a Met last year (.311 BA, 10 HR, 40 R, 41 RBI in 75 games), there's proof the change of scenery worked. 7. I'm not a fan of Murph. Keith Hernandez is working with him on his defense. Thoughts are he'll platoon with Tatis. Maybe Jacobs will win the job. This is a hole, but on Opening Day last year we had Schneider. I'm hoping for midseason upgrade here - maybe Dunn, or even Keith if he wants to put the uniform back on. 8. Barajas plays defense, hits homeruns and doesn't get on base much. He can throw folks out, which will be fun. Also, it's looking like Blanco will be Santana's caddy, and I think that can help. Ok, so the seventh and eighth slots are problems. Still, we have reason to expect way more out of this offense than last year, even if there are some injuries. That leaves us with the bullpen... You have to look way back to find Mets team that had great team chemistry. Not that it\u2019s been bad with the recent Mets, but it definitely has not been great. A key component to a winning team, you can\u2019t buy chemistry. As a GM, putting a team together based on skills, stats, and baseball attributes is tough enough. When you add in the layer of evaluating players\u2019 personalities in a quest to create a team that will get along besides playing great baseball, there\u2019s no clear formula to success. GM\u2019s will target players that will help their club, and besides the few troubled players that some teams will stay away from for the fear of bringing in a \u2018cancer\u2019 to the locker room a la Milton Bradley, chemistry seems to fall under the radar most often than not when making these major investments. When the Mets picked up \u2018Frenchie\u2019 Jeff Francoeur, the last thing that factored into the decision was his personality. As long as he didn\u2019t kill any teammates or coaches in the past, the Mets were bringing him to Queens so they can rid themselves of Church. The Mets never thought anything to the effect of, \u201cthis guys great in the clubhouse, lets find a way to get him\u201d. Well what do you know, Frenchie has brought some life to this team. Lets hope it translates to chemistry, which will at least give Mets fans some quality baseball to watch again. The last time I can truly say I saw a Mets team with great team chemistry, you have to look back to the days of Ron Darling, Tim Teufel and co., causing havoc in some honky tonk Texas bar. That was team chemistry at its finest, you just sensed it. Everyone hated them, outside of NY that is, but they had fun, played great together, and had each others backs no matter what. It was also the last time the New York Mets won the championship. Now we haven\u2019t seen any hotfoots out of Frenchie, but he\u2019s becoming a social leader on the team. Along with newcomer, Jason Bay, they set up a viewing party for the U.S. v Canada gold medal hockey game Sunday. According to Frenchie, Mets can expect more social gatherings this year. Our first trip this year is to Colorado, and we have a Monday night off. Guys can go out all day. But we should go out together at night. Let's go have a ball. As a player, these types of things make the clubhouse a more comfortable place to be in and a place they want to play in. Lets give credit where credit is due, Mets received a huge intangible with Frenchie at a low cost. Gold-Medal Chemistry Builder for Mets [MLB] As Spring approaches, I always get optimistic. Now that it looks like, save for the possible addition of a left-handed reliever, the roster is set, I can start to analyze what it is we have at each position. First, lets take a look at what all of sports radio, and every fan I talk to, says needed to be addressed this offseason - starting pitching. Let's look at the projected rotation vs. last year's Spring projection. 2009 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Tim Redding / Livan Herandez 2010 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Jon Niese / Fernando Nieve / Nelson Figueroa et al. What a difference a year makes? One through four are the same, and last year's depth is now this year's unaddressed problem. The common theory goes: \"you know you get with Johan (even though he's coming off elbow surgery), but 2, 3 and 4 are all head cases.\" Pelfrey regressed in an alarming manner, and you have to hope he'll bounce back in some way. In flashes during the 2008 season, he looked like a legitimate no. 2 starter. Ollie P is a head case, but also has been a big game pitcher for the Mets in the past (and still has electric stuff when focused). Perhaps I would have rather signed Randy Wolf to a one-year deal, and no way was Ollie worth three years a $12 million per, but we was coming off two pretty good seasons with the Mets, especially 2007. There was no reason to expect such a miserable 2009, and while many feel he was shut down due to a phony injury, people don't have surgery on phony injuries. John Maine was obviously still hurt, and maybe we don't know what we'll get from him. While that is a lot of uncertainty, short of signing Lackey or dealing for Halladay (neither of which was realistic for the Mets), there isn't much the Mets could do this offseason to fix it. Armes like Marquis and Pineiro don't move me much. Where I might have taken a chance are high-risk, high-reward guys like Sheets, Wang and Bedard. However, Sheets price himself out, and Wang and Bedard may not pitch until deep into the season (without the help of the Mets' crack medical staff). What we hope for here is a few less injuries. Simply getting something close to 180 innings out of each of these guys will be a dramatic improvement over last season, especially because can't help but improve. Tomorrow I'll discuss the projected lineup and the various improvements over last year."}

The Beach, in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a backpacker in Thailand who thinks he has found a map to paradise, is going to piss off a lot of people just because he's in it. After his unprecedented Titanic splash two years ago, DiCaprio took a vacation from acting, presumably to party, but in the media he was a constant source of backlash-building fascination: all Leo, all the time. The Beach returns DiCaprio, 25, to the screen, not as the talented kid who held his own against Robert De Niro in 1993's This Boy's Life but as a Hollywood player with Titanic-size box-office clout.\n\nDiCaprio received $20 million to play Richard in the film version of Alex Garland's 1996 cult novel about Gen X disillusionment. Wasn't Richard a Brit in the book? No problem - for Leo, you make him American. Wasn't it the plan of director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter John Hodge - the British team behind the indie hits Shallow Grave and Trainspotting -- to make a low-budget film? No problem -- for Leo, you spend $50 million. Wasn't actor Ewan McGregor -- the team player behind Shallow Grave and Trainspotting -- the first choice to play Richard? No problem -- for Leo, you make adjustments.\n\n\nAnd so The Beach comes to the screen freighted with enough Leo baggage to make the movie seem beside the point. It isn't.

His Richard is a pop-culture junkie, constantly pushing the video games he plays to the next level of difficulty and living his life the same way. Traveling alone in Thailand, he checks into a Bangkok flophouse, where the night sounds include a sexy French couple -- Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) -- and a suicidal Scot named Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rambles about a map to a perfect beach on a hidden island. The next day, Richard finds Daffy's bloody corpse and the map. Note: Daffy returns with a vengeance in dream sequences, one of which shows him and Richard gunning down tourists. Yikes."}

Yogi Berra, the Sage of the Grand Concourse, the omphaloskeptic Neapolitan, once said, \"When you come to a fork in the road, you should take it.\" I haven't a clue how one would accomplish that, but I am at a fork in the road. The blame for my erratic blog submissions to ADDitude can be laid on several doorsteps: my innate laziness, my inability to manage my time with any dexterity or consistency, even, mirable dictu, my very affliction with The Deficit. But issues of privacy and modesty, or shame, loom larger and larger. While I'm interested in the whole panorama of the ADHD experience, I find that doing research on the latest ADHD meds or a controversial diet plan is less attractive than looking inward, trying to figure out how the affliction has affected my life, how it interacts with my other shortcomings, and what if anything I can do about it. In addition, I have been told that the postings in which I'm talking about myself, my emotional condition, my constant, one would like to say Homeric, battles with depression and insolvency, attract more readers and more comments than anything I might write about the color of the new Concerta formulations (less, for all the relative frivolity, than the issue of whether there should be blue M&Ms, for example.) But there's a point where I don't want to write about myself. Or, more accurately, want to but feel uncomfortable. After all, I'm sure you're all very nice, concerned, ethical folks. I'm sure the snickering I hear is generated in my own head, and not in yours. But self-revelation has a price, especially in this age where privacy has, for all intents and purposes, become a rare, perhaps non-existent commodity. So I'll continue to try to find a balance between my personal situations and my obligations to my ADHD blog, and if I find it necessary to lie a little here and there, so be it. None of you will ever know the difference, except for a handful of people who know me personally, and, for the most part, I've managed to alienate them sufficiently that they don't care. I'm just sayin', you know?"}

Abdul Kalam is a vvip and he was frisked and even asked to remove his shoes at IGI antional airport in New Delhi by security personnels of Continental Airlines(An U.S. based airlines).It was the boss of the airlines who made it necessary to be checked.Although you must be thinking that everyday many laws are broken why this in particular?because Mr. kalam is a role model for many of us and especially the student community.He represents INDIAN scientist community and frisking him is a fall of national pride .\n\nWell it was a law which was broken in INDIA and it is not made internationally.There are greater offences than this one when we go in past .When George Fernandes was in ministry in NDA regime then he had to go security check in America when he was on an official visit there where as it is clearly stated that any minister from any country is exempted from security checks then why was it performed .It is not only one instance .Pranab mukherjee was coming back from France to India then also he has to go through security checks which is again unforgivable.I am great supporter for equality but then equality must not only be on papers it must be implemented.Checking our role models and people representing a country in name of the security is not permissible and even when it has been stated clearly.\n\nComing back to India a FIR has been registered against the employees concerned but i guess it will not do because they were only the people following orders the issue has to be taken to all the aircraft organisations and clear directives must be given to them and it must be cleared that if there is exemption then it must be applied for all and if there is not then everybody must be checked even a minister from any other country(but atithi devo bhava) .Security checks must be upgraded but not only for publicising it some concrete steps are to be followed other than just checking vvip's."}

After all, with endearing, demented characters like Sam and Max taking up quite a bit of the screen, who cares how many polygons are left for that pot plant in the corner?\n\n\"We wanted to bump everything up presentation-wise for this season,\" said designer Chuck Jordan, drawing attention to the Telltale engine's impressive -- nay, tight -- visual enhancements. The Penal Zone, the first of five monthly episodes comprising Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse, features noticeably improved lighting, real-time shadows and more expressive facial animation. As Jordan pointed out, \"an expression can sell a joke for the first time.\"\n\nBased on the demo I saw at the Game Developers Conference, it's also apparent that the improved graphics do make a difference to that pot plant. Because you transform into one. \"When you finally get to control Max,\" Jordan said, \"it's really weird.\" Like, really really weird.\nGallery: Sam & Max: Devil's Playhouse\n\nOne of Max's newly acquired psychic abilities (accessed from a bizarre first-person viewpoint) allows him to transform into any physical object -- provided he's seen it in the form of a picture or a painting somewhere in the environment (obviously). It's an interesting puzzle-solving device that introduces an ability-driven approach to complement the traditional reliance on inventory item ... and since it lets Max turn into stuff like pot plants and bazookas, it's also super funny.\n\nMore psychic abilities will be unlocked as the season continues -- can they really get stranger than pictorial transformation or telephonic teleportation? -- but the first few already show that Telltale is cognizant of the formulaic fallbacks in a few of its games. Inventory manipulation has also been inverted, prompting you to select an object in the environment first and then pick an item to use from a redesigned interface. Those changes seem to benefit the PlayStation 3 version of The Devil's Playhouse, which also abandons the point-and-click interface in favor of direct control over the demented duo on the left analogue stick.\n\nOf course, it's also worth pointing out that Telltale's excellent, unhinged humor still plays a crucial role in Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse. I don't think fans will be disappointed by the delightful B-movie trappings, not when there's a talking brain, a megalomaniacal ape and a host of unanswered mysteries right from the start. Only an enigmatic narrator (Criswell's cousin?) hints at an explanation, but it's clear that the inevitably absurd answers will gradually be exposed as the season continues from its potent opener."}

I'd done the drawing for this painting about 6 months ago, and thought I'd be able to complete the underpainting in the short time available. After about a week, this layer should be dry, and I'll be able to paint the color layer. I think it should be a nice little painting; I'm looking forward to it. Most of the in-progress images I post here are of work on the final color layer, so I thought I'd show a little window into work on the underpainting (above). Here's the completed underpainting: Tomorrow I'll be starting on a very, very fun project. I'll write a quick post about it in the evening. Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 6 x 11 inches Actually, this painting is done. I won't post final images of it until it has dried and been varnished. It's probably hard to appreciate with this lower-quality shot, but there's a depth and richness to the color that I'm very pleased with, especially the copper, which has become one of my favorite things to paint. I managed to finish it despite the torrential downpours we got here in Eastern Massachusetts; about 8 inches of rain in the last 48 hours - falling on saturated soil from another recent storm. I now have a nice duck pond where my back yard used to be, and water is flowing freely into my basement. However, so far the pumps have done their job, and it's been more of a nuisance than anything else. Others nearby were far less fortunate... mandatory evacuations, submerged automobiles, and all that. Since I barely slept last night dealing with the water, I'm exhausted; think I'll head off to bed early. More progress, and getting close to the finish. At this point, the biggest thing I need to worry about is anchoring the objects to the surface they're sitting on. Objects which aren't properly painted in relation to their context never feel like they have the proper weight and gravity, and as a result sit awkwardly in the painting. And that, of course, just wouldn't do... I wish you all a great weekend. Jeffrey Hayes Work In Progress 5 x 11 inches Here is further progress on my current painting. I really like the idea of building paintings around 2 opposed and unequal groups of objects. It seems to lend the composition some built-in tension and intrigue. I'm almost tempted to call the painting \"Culture Clash\" or something similar, though that's probably more amusing to me than it is to most others. Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 5 x 11 inches This is the very latest piece I've been working on. I don't ordinarily work on one larger piece immediately after finishing another larger piece, but I'd completed the underpainting for this some months ago, and just wanted to get it done. After this, I'll be working on a very cool project; more on that in a few days. After my recent cancer experience , I got a lot of messages of concern and support, so I thought I'd pass along some good news. Today I had my first physical since then, and overall I'm in very good shape. So... back to work for me; I'd like to finish this one as soon as I can! I haven't mentioned it here in a while, but I have an active presence on both Facebook and Twitter.

{"id": "bag-2871", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "On 5 September history was made by 7 Ministers of Health from low-income countries together with serious politicians from West Europe and representatives from aid organisations that had learnt their lessons . The group launched the International Health Partnership. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/files/ihp/default.asp If aid from rich countries should effectively improve health of the poor, they said, the aid must be: 1. coordinated, 2. foucsed on improving health systems as a whole instead of one disease at a time, 3. and part of good national plans. These statements are evidance based, much needed but \"un-sexy\". So let me translate the 3 statements into blunt words: 1. It is mad that Ministries of Health in low-income countries each week must meet a growing number of aid delegations. 2. It is cruel to tell millions of poor mothers; \"your child is dying from pneumonia for which our clinic have no drugs because Bush, Blair and rich activits did not know that pneumonia and diarrhea kill as many as do malaria, TB and HIV. 3. It is stupid to fund seprate clinics for each disease when there is not even staff and money e nough for one clinic in each village. So, 5 September 2007, is a happy day for global health. Fragmented health aid based on what is \"sexy\" in the media of the rish will be replaced by health aid focusing on what is needed in the clinic of the poor. Why is Sweden not yet part of the International Health Partnership? The Swedish Minister for Development Aid recently wisely focused Swedish bilateral aid too fewer countries. So hopefully she will soon join the Partnership of the wise. In these issues it seems more important if politicians are wise than if they come from left or right, so we can hope that Sweden will join. This vlog uses a flash presentation that Gapminder did with Trendalyzer graphics. It shows the development of Sweden during the last 300 years. It is my first attempt to use chroma key video with animated statistics as done daily with weather forcasts in TV. Following my talk in Swedish radio news on how to avaoid child deaths in pneumonia I get requests on where to donate. What is needed is steady funding over many year so that poor families get access to diagnosis and antibiotics. I judge that UNICEF is most competent to provide long-term support for child survival. The reason is good track record, that the present Director Ann Veneman understands how health service system in low income countries need long term support and that UNICEF base their policy on best available research. To save children now donate to http://www.unicef.se/stod_oss/ge_en_gava_har/ if not in Sweden look up UNICEF in your country. To support research for better care for infections of the poor donate to World Infections Fund http://www.vif.se/mallar/donatewwallit.aspx?SidID=10186 . Keep donating regularly to a good cause, and learn about progress and challanges. The underfunded needs are the continious majora challanges for poor families; pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, education and the daily bread, i.e. agriculture in rula areas and job in urban areas. Water and sanitation also get less attention than emergency relief and HIV; the two worthy causes that presently receives almost sufficient funding. Cotton farmers in Texas earn their wealth from Soviet-like government subsidies. The annual 4 billion US dollar tax subsides to 25 000 US cotton farmers are of concern for global health! The reason being that this obstacle to free trade kill so many children. 1. Subsidies hamper economic growth in cotton producing west African countries. This keeps millions of hardworking farmers in poverty and hinder them to care well for their children. http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp30_cotton.htm 2. If only parts of the 4 tax billions were re-directed tovAnn Venneman at UNICEF, she can avoid 600,000 child deaths from pneumonia by using 0.6 billion USD to provide care and antibiotics. http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index_35937.html 3. The soviet cotton economy of Texas is a major obstacle for successful agreements on free world trade. And a fair global trade system will save thelives of so many children\u2019s . http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl57_e.htm The world is waiting for a US president with the guts to implement a cotton Perestroika in Texas! On January 27 at the World Economic Forum in Davos I asked Bill Gates for help. Help to speed up provision of courses on Global Health at universities around the world. I gave him a copy of our Textbook on Global Health (see below). He rightly noted that it was the first of its kind and that fact based overviews of the global health situations are badly needed. On February 7 I got this note from our publisher Studentlitteratur: \"H\u00e4r kommer lite glada nyheter om Global Health. Dessutom har Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation k\u00f6pt 200 ex som deras personal ska l\u00e4sa!\" Gates Foundation had bought 200 copies, one each for the staff! Is it possible to write a book on the health of all 6.5 billion persons living on the globe? Well we did it and now it is on sale from Monday 27/11 2006. We are six authors, but it was Ann Lindstrand who got it together and Birgitta Rubensson that brought it to print. Hundreds of students read and commented various versions. http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_b/203-2244500-9311121?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=rosling We wrote it for those that in a short text want to learn: -how the health of the world's population has changed over time; -how the main determinants of health varied with time and place; -how health can be measured; about the causes of the main diseases in the world; -what health care that exist around the world. Our book is a summary of the works by greater scholars on global health. The pros with our book are the overviews; the cons are the simplifications and errors that are a consequence of our broad ambitions. Yesterday UNAIDS declared: \" the global AIDS epidemic continuous to grow... an estimated 40 millions are living with HIV... the number with HIV has increased from 37 millions in 2004. www.unaids.org But on the AIDS day in 2004 the message from UNAIDS was that \"over 41 million people are living with HIV/AIDS\" http://www.un.org/events/aids/2004/ Are UNAIDS lying? No, it is led by honest and good scientists, so how come? If you dig further into the data you find that the uncertainty range of UNAIDS estimates are wide: - somewhere between 32 to 44 millions lived with HIV in 2004 and today somewhere between 34 to 47 millions. So the true number may be slowly falling. A reasonable conclusion is that the number of HIV infected in the world remains the same over the last years. But telling that may put funding for much needed HIV/AIDS control at risk, so its better to conclude that the epidemic continuous to grow. UNAIDS may be excused for drawing the scary conclusion that the epidemic is still increasing, because they simultaneously communicate that there are solid evidence that the epidemic is decreasing in more and more countries. The exclusive focus on treatment may have delayed the decrease. Best available assessment indicate that money is best used on scaling up prevention http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5766/1474 But international support to prevention tends to focus on the moral of the donor rather than the effectiveness of the action. The present US administration likes to fund \"less sex\" and Sweden likes to fund \"more condoms\". Evidence from Zimbabwe tells that both works.

So does Tim Sanders, it turns out. During my speech at the first ever GR2L event (get ready to live), I talked about shifting from connections into intent. I was talking about networking at that juncture. I want to expand. And I have a comparison/analogy to light this up.\n\nThe difference between talking about human business and social media and doing it is the difference between having recipes and running a restaurant.\n\nWe go to events and network. We collect business cards. Why? Because we don\u2019t know what else to do. We know we\u2019re supposed to network. We talk about why it\u2019s important. The thing is, what do we DO with these? Jon Swanson wrote about switching back to a dumb phone when he realized that he didn\u2019t really have to check email and Twitter every waking hour.\n\nJon\u2019s restaurant doesn\u2019t need an always-on recipe. See it?\n\nIntent and Execution are the gold standard\n\nMy friend (I\u2019m calling us friends) Tom Peters has spent decades on the variation of the theme that \u201cexecution is everything.\u201d He pushes us over and over again to DO. Because again, Tom knows that having a box of recipes is nothing compared to executing on them and putting food down in front of people. Tom urges us to look at the buying trends in the world and realize that Baby Boomers and Women should be our main markets (in most cases).\n\nTom\u2019s restaurant caters to those crowds quite well. Are you doing the same?\n\nOpen With a Few Dishes\n\nHaving a huge recipe box of ideas is one thing. Starting a restaurant and seeing what your guests like is another. We\u2019re all in this space picking up ideas. We go to big events, we read tons of books, we surf hundreds of blogs, but if we\u2019re not trying a few of these recipes out, we\u2019re not really moving forward. We\u2019re thinking plenty more than we\u2019re doing.\n\nWhat recipes should you start on today? (Here\u2019s a hint: pick just a few, or one, and learn to make it so that your guests sing.)\n\nI Believe This is a BIG Thing\n\nI think we have to accept that we have a big enough recipe box. I think we have to look at what kind of \u201crestaurant\u201d we want to run, what kind of guest we hope to attract, what kind of cost-per-dish we\u2019re aiming for, and what kind of experience we want people to have\u2026\n\n\u2026and then we have to DO.\n\nWill you take a moment and talk about your restaurant?

Last Tuesday I experienced for only the second time in my 13 years of law enforcement a traffic stop initiated by the violator. Yes, while traveling on I-44 Interstate I got behind a vehicle that was going a bit faster than the posted speed limit. He noticed me in his rear view mirror and changed lanes. Obviously he was unaware of my intentions to change lanes anyway as I was about to exit off of I-40. As soon as I changed lanes and was again behind him he turned on his flashers and began to pull onto the shoulder. Well, I had the notion of what he was doing and just to make sure he wasn't braking down I pulled off onto the shoulder also and turned on my emergency lights. I walked up to the drivers door and he was already gathering his state driver's license and insurance forms. I asked him if everything was alright and he stated, \" I know I was speeding\". I said yes he was and since he was aware of it to slow down and then got back in my car. I think I left him a bit puzzled but I insist that regardless to how many tickets I might write, if I can change the driving mentality if just while I'm present I've done my job. \nMrs. Dub was complaining Sunday about Daylight Savings Time, commenting on how much she hates it and hates losing that hour of sleep.

Miss Dub has been chomping at the bit to go and shoot. I can even get her to clean my guns with less hassle than feeding the horses. I brought the whole armament of the pistols, shotgun and AR-15's. This was their first time with the rifles and shotguns. We got some practice in on the paper targets and then I turned them loose on the steel targets. Everyone loves these as you get the \"tink\" sound when you hit the target. Later in the afternoon we went and saw the new \"Alice in Wonderland\", 3D of course.

If we don't know this person, we will most likely be entirely right about what made him obese in the first place, but we shouldn't assume that he has not already repented from this lifestyle. For example, take the picture that started the obesity discussion on the Bayly Blog. It's impossible to ignore that the man on the right is quite obese and seems pleased, even proud of the fact. He seems delighted to point out his resemblance to a pregnant woman. His condition --- which would be alarming if we had not already become so used to seeing obese men in our culture --- has gone way beyond a \"few extra pounds\" or a \"little flab around the middle\" that we might be able to blame on stress or joyous feasting with family over the holidays. His situation, like that of way too many others, is far more grave and serious than that. However, it is wrong, if we don't know this man and his history, to assume that he is currently still overeating and not exercising and/or working enough. When we see people in his condition, we don't always know what they were like some months back. For instance, I recently met a woman who is obese but who is also, at least for the past six months or so, one of the hardest working, most sensible eaters I've ever met.

Well, not all of us\u2014but at least the ones who are used to catering to everybody else's needs (and putting off their own dinner)&nbsp;at a certain time of the day. Katahdin Cute Overload It's a funny thing about our sheep shearer \u2014he raises sheep that don't need to be sheared. They're Katahdins, and this hardy breed has hair rather than wool that, as you can see here , comes off each year on its own. One of the biggest problems we face raising our mostly Suffolk meat sheep here in Missouri is internal parasites, specifically a blood sucking stomach worm known as the barber pole or wire worm . For much of the year it's wet and warm here, which, unfortunately, is Parasite Paradise. Despite agressively using both commercial and natural wormers, we've lost numerous sheep over the years to worms\u2014and we've been comparatively lucky. I know of one farmer who had most of her flock drop dead from internal parasites\u2014the day after they'd been wormed. It's terrible. And while there were many benefits to having that extra rain during the past two springs and summers, it made the parasite problem even worse. Ram Lambs Lined Up for Our Inspection (we chose the one on the far left) Katahdin sheep are naturally parasite resistant, and a couple of years ago we got to talking about them with our shearer while he was shearing our sheep. A few weeks later we drove over to his farm and picked out a three-month-old, 75-pound, registered Katahdin ram lamb (whose father was a US champion) to breed to our mostly Suffolk ewes. When Joe saw me squealing over all the corralled cuteness before I could even climb out of the truck, he said it was a really good thing we hadn't brought a big stock trailer. You Carry the Lamb Low so the Mama Can See and Smell It We also got a great deal on two registered Katahdin ewes who each had a newborn lamb by their side, including one&nbsp;who had been born that morning. These were the first ewes I purchased since buying my original flock back in 1995. I've always&nbsp;kept a closed flock, expanding it by holding back the best ewe lambs. The only sheep purchased and brought in were rams, which&nbsp;are replaced every couple of years to avoid inbreeding. The New Ram and the Littlest New Member of the Flock Sadly, the strapping Katahdin ram lamb was killed by coyotes out in the front field the first morning he was let out of his quarantine holding pen. You can read more about that terrible killing season (which, paws crossed, is permanently over thanks to our super livestock guardian dogs, Marta and Daisy ) here . Edward on the Job in Fall 2009 (the girls sometimes play hard to get) Not willing to give up on our plan, we returned to the sheep shearer's farm and picked out another young Katahdin ram. We named him Edward, and in spring 2009, our first Katahdin/Suffolk cross lambs were born. (There are some other breeds mixed in, bred down from some of my original mixed breed ewes, from the Border Leicester ram I used the first few years, and from a wonderful Hampshire ram we had in 2002 and 2003.) We also bred the two Katahdin ewes&nbsp;with Edward in order to get some more purebred Katahdins, and they each had twins. Emmy Lou Back Then And Emmy Lou Now The Katahdin ewe lamb that arrived here as a newborn, and who I recently (finally!) named Emmy Lou, was also bred when Edward jumped through 11 strands of barbed wire in order to continue breeding season (another story I never got around to telling). She gave birth in spring 2009 to this little cutie pie we named Friendly. The other newborn lamb was a ram, and he eventually went into our freezer so we could see how we liked the taste of Katahdin meat (it's very good). That gave us a total of seven purebred Katahdin ewes to breed. We've been thrilled so far with these Katahdin and Katahdin crosses and have high hopes going into spring grazing season, which is one of the wormiest times of the year, especially since hormones in the nursing ewes make them especially susceptible. We're still aggressively worming, but now we're mostly using a drench (liquid squirted into the throat with a drench 'gun' connected to a 'backpack' holding the liquid) of organic raw apple cider vinegar and garlic juice. - We're also still adding diatomaceous earth, an all natural wormer (which has dozens of other uses, especially in the garden), in with both their grain treats and salt/mineral mix. Our sheep have never looked better. Even the lambs of the ewes who had bad parasite problems last year aren't wormy. Okay, I hadn't planned to go all the way back to 2008 to begin the explanation of why our 2010 lambing season started several weeks earlier than expected, but I've actually been meaning to explain how and why we now have Katahdins ever since we got them, especially&nbsp;since many of you have been asking. Anyway, when I called the sheep shearer to arrange this year's shearing , I asked if he happened to have any big Katahdin ewes for sale, big enough to breed with our big Suffolk ram, Da Big Guy, and he said yes. He had some pregnant six-year-olds for sale who were good sheep with nothing wrong except that they were six years old (many sheep breeders prefer to not to keep ewes older than five). He even could deliver them when he came to shear. I asked him to pick out the two biggest ewes, and he brought us these gorgeous girls\u2014who both had triplets last year. My main concern with the Katahdins is that we're going to lose the nice big size we've built up over the years with the Suffolks. I prefer to butcher the lambs at about 130 or even 140 pounds, and the purebred Katahdin lambs aren't getting that big. You just don't get as much meat otherwise. We always take the smallest lambs for ourselves, and some years they've only been about 100 pounds, but our customers prefer them bigger (some want them over 150 pounds if possible)\u2014and since the butcher charges a flat processing fee, they also get more for their money with bigger lambs. In 2004, we started naming all babies born on the farm alphabetically: 'A' names for 2004, 'B' names for 2005, etc. It makes things so much easier (and only took me nine years to come up with the idea). Some of you know how long it can take to get a name around here, but amazingly, we've already named our new ewes who were born back in the 'A' year. This is Ava And this is Audrey Ava\u2014whose full name is Ava Gardener so we can remember that these ewes came to live with us in 2010, the 'G' name year\u2014gave birth to these incredibly cute twins last Monday. You can see more photos of them here and here . Audrey just keeps getting bigger. The rest of the ewes should start giving birth around April 1st! Can't wait?

Here are Answers.\nImagine the scene \u2026 members of the law firm\u2019s Executive Committee sitting around a conference table, unable to reach agreement on which legal marketing programs to implement. There are so many choices now, from Google AdWords to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other forms of social media. \n\nLegal marketing used to be simple. The Yellow Pages served as a leading advertising channel for personal injury attorneys, while a basic website and nice brochure met the marketing needs of most plaintiff or defense law firms. Add in a strong referral network, and the average law firm of 20 years ago was able to keep the phones ringing without too much work. \n\nHow times have changed! Effective legal marketing now involves many specialists, from search engine optimizers to video technicians and website analytics experts. Of course, you still need copywriters, graphic designers, and event coordinators. \n\nToday\u2019s competitive marketplace frequently delivers business to the law firms that can master marketing, rather than the best law firms. Does all this sound familiar? \n\nAvoid Inaction in the Face of Uncertainty\n\nConfusion is a common response I see among lawyers struggling to select the best marketing approach. A natural tendency under these circumstances is for the law firm to either do nothing, or to continue with the same tired marketing techniques that deliver unsatisfactory results. \n\nMarketing your law firm is a critical issue, and the economic downturn has left many firms scrambling to fill their pipeline. There is no time to wait. The good news is that there is a silver lining in the rapid changes of technology and promotional techniques. \n\nLet the Market Guide your Promotional Campaigns\n\nRather than fighting with your law partners over who has the best marketing ideas, turn to the marketplace for answers. Marketing is both art and science, where only actual response rates can truly determine the best promotional campaigns for your law firm. \n\nDevelop a plan to systematically test new or modified marketing strategies, keeping those that work and discarding the rest. Internet marketing offers an unprecedented ability to monitor campaign performance on an almost real-time basis, so you will be able to compare response rates and client acquisition costs across multiple promotions. \n\nSmart Choices in Budget Allocations\n\nYour marketing budget should be spread across an integrated set of marketing channels (i.e., Internet, sponsorships, events, and advertising) and scheduled against a written timeline with specific goals. Remember that current clients are your best source of new revenue, so be sure to earmark funds for client retention. Take advantage also of the many free or low cost legal directories offered by firms like Avvo, Justia and HG.org to easily increase your online visibility. \n\nRemember, never stop marketing!

Women have smaller lung capacity than men, which can make women feel as though they are working harder than men even if the women are working at the same level. This can also make exercise feel harder in the heat or high humidity. This doesn't mean it's impossible for women to lose weight and, when you think about, excellent reasons are behind a woman's tendency to store fat. After all, creating and nurturing a new life is nothing to sneeze at. It's always best to avoid comparing yourself to others, whether male or female, when it comes to weight loss. Everyone loses weight differently, and genes, along with hormones, play a large role in how quickly some people lose weight."}

Post Secret is a project started a few years ago by a man named Frank. Frank left a few postcards in a few public places with simple instructions. Write a secret on it, decorate it if you like, and send it in, anonymously, to the address already written on the card. It grew into quite a phenomena. Now, Frank gets postcards from all over the world. He's compiled them and published more than one book. And every Sunday, Frank posts a new set of secrets on postsecret.com. Even with the books and the website, only a fraction of the secrets are viewed.\n\nEvery Sunday, I log on to my computer, excited to see the new secrets. It's a simple pleasure that I truly enjoy. The secrets are often sad, sometimes disturbing, occasionally funny, but always insightful.\n\nEveryone has secrets. Little secrets, like you really don't like your friend's new haircut. Unimportant secrets, like it was you who ate all the blueberries(an actual secret that made me laugh out loud). And big, important secrets, ones you don't even dare think about for fear of inexplicably blurting out loud simply from the weight of it."}
{"id": "bag-2308", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "Phase 1: Lagos\n\nStep 1: Arrive at the airport. The power goes out while your luggage is still being brought out on the carrel. So you have to drag your two excessively overweight bags off the carrel while holding on to your precious laptop bag as well the carry-on bag you brought off the plane. Then you realize that the carts aren't free\u2026..and you have no naira. So you drape the carry on and laptop bag on each shoulder then drag your two suitcases out of the airport. You get outside and realize that you also have no cell phone and that the nearest call place is \"waaaaaay down that way\"\u2026\u2026\n\n\n\nStep 2: You leave your aunt's house ready to go a-visiting. Then they tell you that the cabs are just a \"little up the road\". As you have sworn with all that is in you to never get on an okada, you decide to walk there. Conveniently, you forget that you're smack dab in the middle of the tropics during HARMATTAN season no less and that when you left it was snowing. You arrive sweating and exhausted at the car park then breathlessly tell the cab man the address. But it's not over, because the bloody bastard is trying to gouge out your eyes and cut off your right arm and left leg (get it??), so you gather your final strength and revive all your haggling skills. Finally, when you're both satisfied, you sink into the backseat and endure the hot, dusty ride.\n\n\n\nPhase 2: Ibadan\n\nStep 1: Your mom generously drops you off at your friend's house. She even lets you take the wheel. No biggie you think remembering all the weaving through traffic and switching lanes at 100 mph that you've come to enjoy. So you get on the road. It's an easy drive up your long street. You get on the main road, your mom's relaxed. Gabbing on the phone informing all and sundry that you are around and ready to be taxed so feel free to drop by. You get to a major junction. There's a policeman there directing traffic. You patiently wait your turn, and when he directs you and you move. Ah this isn't so bad you think. Then you get to another junction and you let the cars with the right of way pass you\n\n\"what are you doing?\"\n\n\"huh?\"\n\n\"my friend will you move?\"\n\n\"but mummy it isn't my turn\"\n\nYou hear the snort from the person she is currently gabbing with. By the time you get to your friend's house, all you want to do is curl up into a ball and rock back and forth.\n\n\n\nStep 2: While at your friend's house, you decide to attend evening mass. You faintly recall that it was a short walk from their place. Plus it's evening so it's nice outside. You proceed to walk expecting any moment to see the steeple. You climb up a hill. Then you walk down another, artfully dodging okadas and wayward cars. Can't these people see that you're a pedestrian you fume. Finally, you get to church and say a small prayer of thanks that you convinced your friend to come get you after church. Mass takes way longer than it used to. Your friend has sent a text telling you he got tired of waiting outside so you should meet at the restaurant down the street. WHY ME you cry in your heart as you wearily trudge to the spot, planning how you'll chop off his head if he even suggests that you just walk home.\n\n\nStep 3: Aaaah your friend's AC works. You sit back in the car and just enjoy the coolness of it while you reminisce about those bottles of real cold water you just downed. Then you feel a rumble. You look around in shock thinking o Lord are there earthquakes now in Nigeria? Then you realize its coming from your tummy. Your mind flashes back to the orgasmic moi-moi and ogi you had for breakfast. Your stomach rumbles again, and you wonder why your friend is suddenly driving so slowly. Good God man drive damn you! As you struggle to hold it all in, it comes back to you that you only ever used to eat moi-moi or any other beans products in the evening and only if there was tons of bread available. As you finally sink onto the toilet seat and settle down with your book for a long visit, you think how this is a much more effective and better tasting alternative to the horrid Chinese slimming tea you'd been on.

Scout is getting upset and Marvin is ready to leave without him. Ha!) Tomorrow, I am meeting a blogger friend from The Retirement Chronicles for lunch in Mackinaw City. This will make the fifth blogger friend I've met in person so far. Watch out - you could be next! This past weekend we went to the Detroit Kennel Dog Club Show and Scout's brother won 2nd place in the Bernese Mountain dog puppy division! His name is Jet. (And at our last play date, he kept making out with Scout and I had to tell him to take it easy!) Here's a photo of Jet. Isn't he a handsome boy? It was fun to see so many Bernese Mountain Dogs in one place. I wanted to take this boy home with me but his owner said no. I fell in love with this Anatolian Shepherd and decided I want one of these too! Greg dragged me away from the breeder, begging them not to answer my questions and to just ignore me. (I got their business card - ha!) And finally, doesn't this sign crack you up? Scout: I'm having a great day today! It's sunny and I've been playing in the backyard! As long as I have my mommy, dirt to dig and toys to bury, I'm very happy! Marvin: All I need is a patch of sunlight and for that dog to stay outside - and then it's a great day! My Loons should be back within the next 30 days. I'm so excited! I have to get ready. Get the kayak geared up. Another memory card for my camera. And a bull horn so I can yell at all those boaters and jet skiers who get too close to my Loon babies! Here's a video so you can hear how beautiful the Loons sound. Okay, some of you already know how I'm always waving from the deck of my log cabin to my non-acknowledging neighbors across the lake. About half the time it's in the morning when I'm wearing my crazy pajama pants and now combined with my big fluffy ski coat. Looks great, I promise! (HA!) Anyways, the ice fishermen fascinate me. I'm always checking them out with the binoculars to see if they've caught any fish. Imagine my surprise when I was looking at them and saw one of them looking back at me with their binoculars! I waved. And you know what.....he waved too! I'm making progress people..... Do you think I need to throw this bird feeder away? Some updates: School is going well! I was recently inducted into Phi Theta Kappa which is an honors program for community colleges. Greg is joking now he's married to a sorority girl! Okay - then on spring break, he better take me to Florida! Also, I've been volunteering at a local hospital and just love it. The highlight of my week last week is when this angry man was yelling and swearing at a fellow volunteer next to me because he felt like she gave him inadequate directions. When he left, I asked the woman \"Who is that?\" She replied \"The pastor!\" LOL!!!! I miss all of you and will be around to visit. (I miss your humor Suz & Jen, I miss your stories and history Betsy, I miss your decorating Penny, I miss your comments Wendy a.k.a. little sis, I miss your projects Sandi, I miss all your interesting tidbits Mildred - and so much more!) Please let me know if I've missed anything! I think it's already snowed 4 or 5 inches and it's still coming down! About 26 degrees but the weatherman says \"it feels like 14\" - okay then. School was canceled tonight - woo hoo! Oh wait, I don't have any classes on Tuesday night...figures! How is the weather in your neck of the woods today? Here's some photos of my snow monster Scout enjoying the snow! She is a tomboy just like her mom... This sign is posted in our moose-themed bathroom.

I mean, you aren't working against the kind of sophisticated public relations machine typically reserved for say, a Kardashian. You're not even handling a hot potato. If it weren't for the lucky strike of stumbling into a minority by nominating a candidate who, up close, appeared to be melting, Republicans wouldn't even be able to consider their drumbeat of \"NO!\" much of a message at all. Putting aside the deep irony - Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman both filed amicus briefs when Ralph Nader challenged the Constitutionality of the so-called \"Slaughter Rule\" - Democratic leaders immediately fell prey to the only response \"deem\"-ing a bill passed can possibly elicit.\n\nNo. Seriously. WTF (followed, as usual, by \"Tea Party,\" but that's another story for another day).\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd be happy to adopt a \"deem\" and \"pass\" approach to almost anything. Louboutains too expensive? I deem them passed into my closet. Parking too tough? I deem and pass my double parking into legitimacy. Deeming and passing a flurry of ideas would not only ensure that the world bows to my dominion, but would, frankly, make Congress more effective. But call me skeptical that an $800+ billion spending bill should be deemed to have passed just like that. Beyond feeling powerless in the whole matter, I feel like I should have the right to know if my Congressman decided, for example, to have his vote purchased with earmark spending or a lobbyist-sponsored \"fact-finding\" trip to the Caymans.\n\nNot to mention, the current bill happens to be unpopular. Which presents a problem. The real solution would be to go back to the drawing board and draft a bill we can all live with, but that involves work - which people get themselves elected to Congress to avoid - and if they spend more than one more week addressing health care as opposed to, say, dramatic job losses, Congress will see its approval rating sink even lower...perhaps to the level of their Kardashian rivals.\n\nSo faced with a decision - significant work or pass an unpopular bill through a back door method that people don't quite understand - Democrats chose the latter."}

As we got to know him...well, I have to admit that he sometimes made me feel like I did when I was a little girl and hero-worshiped a heroic policeman. Mark Riddering was a good cop. He was a true hero. He was also one of the sweetest, kindest men I've ever met. I loved watching him interact with his kids, loved watching how he looked at them, how he played with them, how he so obviously cherished them and his wife. He enjoyed life...enjoyed his family...enjoyed his many, many friends. I don't think I'll ever forget his smile or his laugh. We knew Mark during the time when he began noticing troubling symptoms, and when he received the diagnosis of ALS. He was an important part of the weekly Bible study that first met in his home and later in ours. We all watched him walk through this time of uncertainty. If he felt sorry for himself, we never knew it --- his concern was always for his family...and that he would be found faithful in God's eyes. Over the months and years, we watched his big strong body deteriorate. Never once did we hear him complain. Instead, we still heard him laugh and still enjoyed his smiles, his loving concern for our family, and his sense of humor. He encouraged others over and over again."}

In my own mind, my future goals are simple. I want to go back to Macau- a small place with an incredible amount of life, culture and worlds packed on top of each other. \n\nI want to work with local Christians to start a \"L'Abri\" type center for kids at risk, providing counseling, skill training in English and jobs, music and art classes and eventually a live-in center for kids who don't fit in the normal education system. I want to show them that this life is real, the decisions they make are real; that there is more to this life than money. I want to show them that this reality is Jesus. I want to spend my life among these people, not as a leader but as a representative of Jesus; as a friend. I want to do this not for the response that I may get but because an act of love; of incarnation is always valuable. I want to live upstairs in this center and grow flowers with my husband who does whatever job glorifies God and makes him happy and who also is committed to incarnational living. My mom will be happy to know that I do hope to give her grandchildren...someday. When I retire, I want to run a flower shop with Tina Cheong.\n\nWhat's special about this? I think it's just the location...or maybe it should be only the location. \n\nBut being in my hometown inevitably makes me feel strange. The things that I have achieved, the friends that know me best, the goals that I have given myself to since graduating from highschool are not represented here. I would like to face something that I have always tried to ignore: I am an outsider here. Maybe if I had gone to Hart or Shelby High I would have enough warm memories of the past to tie me together with people that I grew up with. \n\nMaybe if I had learned earlier that spirituality has a lot to do with laughter I would have made bridges with friends from highschool. I spoke too much truth without dancing; made goals without warmth.  People here have always been good to me, but sometimes I wonder if that is because they like me or because they are trying to do the \"right\" thing. It is an interesting cycle that many people my age left Hart for a while only to return when they married and had families. This is a good place for stable people. Maybe I am not stable enough yet. I am too idealistic. I am too passionate. If I care about something I can't laugh it off. Perhaps I am perceived as a ballastic missile fallen in a farmer's field. Mabye if I was a guy my gifts would make more sense to people here. Maybe I think too much.\n\n I am a white person who sometimes thinks in Chinese, I am an evangelical Christian who is not Republican. I believe in committment and loyalty but I have moved at least 8 times in 5 years. \n\nThe problem is that I care too much. I don't think I will ever be able to give up trying, and I can't just say the way I think is my neurosis and move on. I can't turn my back on this place because I don't think that is the right thing to do. I am not someone who doesn't care how many people dislike them. I am an idealist. I think things can always be better. People can always change. A crippled relationship is better than a cut-off relationship because there is still chance for improvement. But this also means that there might be infection and no healing.\n\nIs this idealism or addiction?"}

According to one medical weight chart, I am currently, at 130 pounds, overweight for my age, height, and frame size. I could make excuses, insist that I am healthy at this weight, etc., etc. but I know the real truth: I am at this weight because I've been eating too much and not exercising as much as I should, especially over the holidays. For some people of approximately my size, 130 pounds would be a wonderful weight. The weight chart says I should be at around 115 - 120.

It's 95 degrees, then it suddenly hails, then it goes back to 95 degrees with a humidity index of 99%. You spot a boy who wears a smaller jean size than you and you are determined to make out with him by the end of the night. It's late, you're drunk off of Lone Stars because you only had seven breakfast tacos about twelve hours ago, and you have blisters lining the bottom of your feet. These are questions and scenarios that will arise this week during SXSW. Don't be unprepared! Follow my survival guide list below and you're sure to have a worth-while and healthy SXSW experience. 1.) The Fanny Pack - Fuck purses. Who said these ever went out of style? WHO? TELL ME! I recommend the American Apparel shiny denim fanny pack in royal blue because it's awe-inspiring. Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Pretty. 2 .) A Pair of Tom's Shoes - Never mind. These hipster staples are like having a thin layer of burlap separating you from the ground. I can't believe they're donated to a child every time a pair is sold. The next generation is going to grow up all jacked with arthritis. (-this statement is in jest...Tom's is a great company that does a lot of wonderful things) 3.) Cheap Brightly Colored Wayfarers - Because in a way we're all still stuck in 2004, aren't we? 4.) Cardigan - Texas weather is known to be a fickle one, so make sure to carry around a cardigan with you for night or when it spontaneously rains though the precipitation level is 0%. Also, throwing on a cardigan over any shitty ol' outfit, will suddenly make you look more intelligent than you actually are. 5.) Clean Underwear - 'Cause Lord only knows what you're going to do with your current pair of underwear. 6.) Scrunchies - Ladies, you make fun of them, but you know you secretly love them. Who is going to hold back your hair when you're puking up all that free Hornito's in the Beauty Bar toliet? Not that DJ with the florescent bike cap. He's been eyeing the girl with the non-prescription horn-rimmed glasses that are over-taking her face all night. You always have a friend in the scrunchie.&nbsp; 7.) Fake Mustache - Because you don't want to feel left out in this city. 8.) Business Cards - Business cards legitimize you. Even if you have nothing to sell.&nbsp; 9.) Granola Bars - The nice thing about Austin is that we're not a bunch of assholes that bump up the price of everything while you're visiting. However, your eating times might be off and in order to not get wasted by 4PM, it's worth carrying some snacks around with you (Dear Lord. I sound like my mother). 10.) Water- Blah blah blah boring 11.) $1's - For when you wander off alone to the strip club near the airport during a drunken blackout. Right, Marcos? 12.) Air Mattress - Often enough couches are better than air mattresses. Most of the time you wake on the hard wood floor, the mattress having deflated like that of your hard-on after popping way too many Adderall. However, the couch might already be taken by the time you get there, so make sure you come prepared.&nbsp; 13.) Chapstic k - Because by the end of the night, your mouth is going to look like that of a crusty crack addict. 14.) Condoms 15.) Diana Camera - To commemorate the night you get shit-faced with Bill Murray or corner David Byrne up against a wall and explain to him how you two were always meant to be together...in lo-fi. Not that long ago, I received an email from an Austin-based musician very eloquently sharing with me the day he realized he was a hipster. His words were poignant, describing his realization as though he was suddenly inflicted with an incurable disease- Hipstermystalacosis. I related to his story and I think you will too. When I was thirteen and running around in suspenders and non-prescription eyeglasses, I knew there was a name for me. For years I fought the label, but gave up my denial of being a hipster when I christened the name of my blog Hipstercrite. Now when someone calls me a hipster, I shake my head in agreement. I am a hipster and probably always will be. Hipsters, stand up tall! Unite! Dear Lauren, I've been an admirer of your page for a few months. I was linked through \"TapeBombs,\" a music blog run by an acquaintance of mine. Like you, I am dangerously preoccupied with hipsterism and spend a good deal of my day confronting the issue. The reason I am mailing is because I think I represent an interesting case study: a person caught in the paralyzing fear of his latent hipsterism and shocked into his true identity by a harrowing event. Here is my account: I was riding my bike down Duval and the sun was out. At this point I believed firmly in my individuality. Of course, my handlebar wrap matched my brake housing, and the same with the metal cages that held my water bottles; all were red. I wore purple shoes and no helmet. The memory of a triumphant sexual encounter arose quickly, then left. I was pleased with my performance and didn't dwell on the details, didn't analyze a thing. I only recalled the sensations and sounds that make good sex memorable. The day was warm. Readjusting my fingers on bar, I found them to be quite cool; I hadn't begun to sweat. The best part of the ride. In the first few seconds of what would be the minute and a half that changed my life, I didn't recognize the origin of the rumble, growing closer, rapidly becoming a roar, like the slow onset of a far off thunderclap. The sound came from the twin tail pipes of a Chevy Diesel truck. Suddenly, they were upon me. As I turned down a steep hill near 51st and Lamar, I was forced against the curb. The huge wheels of the truck kicked up dust and rocks and I was struck by a few of them. A large white male leaned out of the passenger window, ejecting a thimble-full of spit across the front of my shirt. A beer bottle whizzed over my head. I felt like a frightened Russian Hussar riding against Napoleon, holding out my hand as if to protect myself from the zip of bullets and the whistle of passing artillery. At this point, about a foot separated my handle-bars and the side of the truck. After a few more terrifying seconds, the truck sped up quickly, finishing the descent and pulling into a parking lot at the bottom of the hill. I knew what they had in mind. But remember, I was not some pussy hipster. I was not androgynous. I was a man. That archaic sense of honor strengthened me. Four men stepped out (the type of men who buy their groceries at the county feed store). They came at me from thirty yards away, not running, but at a kind of a trot, like this was a leisure activity. I lept off of my bike and approached them in the middle of the lot. I put my dukes up, lithely shifting from side to side with the assured stance of an experienced boxer. I think they sensed my confidence, baseless as it was. They stopped about ten feet away. I held my ground. Each wore what looked to be an Ed Hardy tee. Only I didn't sense the danger then. I was like a cornered puma, fiercer because death clears away the vale of fear. Underneath the decorated tees, the four mens limbs were taut and ready. One word, one altered expression would have uncapped that explosive energy. But there was silence. The crack of bat, followed by childrens laughter, echoed from the top of the hill. We measured one another. It was the leader who broke the silence. His followers relaxed. The engagement was apparently broken off, or at least postponed for a moment. He said, \" Fuck you, limp dicked hipster.\" His friends didn't laugh, but chimed in. \"Pussy! Hipster! Faggot!\" I didn't reply. I had relaxed my stance. The passenger side agitator spat at me again, but missed. Twenty seconds later the truck was gone and I was left alone in the bright sun. My world view was completely fucking shattered. What passed through my mind as I gingerly pedaled home was not so much the glorious afterglow of a manly confrontation, but the providential nature of my lot in life. I knew that, so far as the outside world was concerned, I was a hipster. Whatever innate qualities I possessed were in dichotomous opposition to a certain portion of society, whose hatred of my \"type\" acted as a form of self-actualization. This tension was absolutely necessary, and in a larger sense, determined my ultimate role in history. I still have not recovered, not fully. Now, when I listen to my own music, songs like \"Don't Try and Take My Guns,\" \"Burning Panties,\" and \"You Should Start A Band,\" I do not hear the voice of myself, but someone who struggles to hide the mark of an old wound. And while I am ashamed and at times it all seems clownish and sad, I remember that this is what makes good art - that is, fear and its poignant beauty, like a shivering mouse you've caught in a beam of light. My story is that of the reluctant hipster. In your word, \"pretending we're not hipsters is what we do best.\" In this way, I am surely the most resourceful of hipsters. But, unlike so many others, it has enriched my art and given me a new purpose; or more nearly, an enhanced clarity of vision.

Stopped at a traffic light last Friday afternoon, I glanced up at a familiar restaurant marquee that usually carried a quip relating to the latest music festival/bike rally/music rally/bike festival in Austin that week. However, this time the words bore a different sentiment: \"Go Texas! Win it for Leslie !\" The light turned green and I found myself driving south down Congress Avenue with tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids. Every Austinite knows who Leslie is. He is the city mascot. The epitome of what makes Austin unique. For those who do not know him, Leslie Cochran is a homeless man who wears a leopard print thong. He has run for city mayor multiple times and has been reviewed 53 times on Yelp . He is an extremely articulate and sweet-natured man. No one has a bad thing to say about Leslie. Which is why it's so surprising that unnamed assailants beat Leslie to unconsciousness two weeks ago. Leslie was in bad shape and listed in critical condition. The townspeople formed a vigil and the local news gave daily updates on his health. It was looking like Leslie was not going to make it, but miraculously he pulled through and was released from the hospital last week. He has since thanked the locals for their support, stating that he would have not made it through otherwise. Though a percentage of his medical bills have been taken care of, there will be a fundraiser on November 1st to help pay the rest. By the time I read the sign last Friday, I knew that Leslie was alive and well. What made me tear up was the realization that I live in a town that cares immensely for an eccentric homeless man. It's also a city where that same homeless man can run for mayor multiple times and still get thousands of votes. Last month marked my one year anniversary of moving to Austin. I moved here with no road map and only what I could fit in my car. The plan was to stay a few months and then see where my ADD took me next. However, whatever energy that made me curious enough to move here has made me stay here. I could tell after my first night in Austin that I was someplace special and I haven't wanted to leave since. Each day this city inspires me more and more and at moments I can honestly say that I'm in love (that could also be because I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time). So in honor of this city that took me in with open arms after fleeing a tumultuous relationship with Los Angeles, I will begin using this blog for part-time Austin \"goings-on\", part-time hipstercrite musings. not sure who the owner of this picture is, but thanks Everyone ought to have a Lower East Side in their lif e- Irving Berlin The East Side has typically been synonymous with art, culture, history, and grit. When we venture through LES in NYC or Wicker Park in Chicago or Silver Lake in Los Angeles, we feel like we've stepped back into time, that we're not necessarily welcome, and that at any moment something wonderful or terrible might happen. This also goes for Austin's east side. A vibrant and fascinating part of the city, Eastside boasts eclectic eateries, trendy bars, and dozens of notable art galleries all maintaining the feel of a bygone era. Chances are you'll be spending some time over on the Eastside during SXSW and if so, you might want to know where to eat (if you aren't stuffed full of free breakfast tacos supplied at the parties). Here is a list of some of the best East Austin restaurants, cafes, and bars: Best Pizz a: East Side Pies 1401 Rosewood Ave. Many will say that Homeslice on SoCo is the best pizza in Austin, but they're embarrassingly wrong. East Side Pies is hands down the best and most imaginative pizza around. Try their Veggie Nacho pizza topped with spicy black bean sauce, onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and avocados. Or their Blue Moon which is a tomato-less pizza topped with feta, mozzarella, ricotta, goat, romano , and blue cheeses. They also supply delicious salads, blondie brownies, and bottled sodas. The staff is awesomely sassy and the place is a little small and very busy, so make sure you don't dilly-dally. Price: Cheese slice $2.50/Meat or veggie slice $3.00 Best Vegan/Vegetarian: Mr. Natural 1901 E. Cesar Chavez One of two Mr. Natural locations in Austin, this restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of the east side. Both a restaurant and a health food store, Mr. Natural supplies an assortment of food options ranging from a vegan/vegetarian lunch and dinner bar that changes daily to delicious baked goods to cakes to homemade juices. Absolutely worth trying is the Soya Guisada on Fridays and the vegan mint chocolate cupcake. You will never think of veganism the same way again. Price: Lunch buffet $7.99, pastries range from .75-$3.50 Best Mexican : Juan in a Million 2300 E. Cesar Chavez This was a hard category to decide in. I like a lot of Mexican food on the Eastside : Aranda's simplicity, El Chile's creativity, and all the taco trailers in between. I chose Juan in a Million because it's the most famous Mexican food restaurant on the Eastside , having been featured on the Travel Channel's Man vs. Food and Countdown Chowdown . Juan in a Million is most famous for their \"Don Juan\", a potato, bacon, egg, and cheese scramble that, which I believe, has been cooked on the same griddle for over twenty years. It's also $3.60 and could last you two days! The atmosphere is quaint, but make sure to go at off times. Especially on the weekend, lines can form down the sidewalk! Price: The Don Juan $3.60 Best Sandwich: Bossa Nova 2121 E. 6 th St. Located across the street from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, this Brazilian eatery has some of the best food on the east side. Don't let the fact that it's Brazilian scare you away- their menu is plentiful and delicious while still being unique. My favorite sandwich (when I eat meat) is the Misto Tudo which has turkey, ham, sliced egg, green olives, palm, and mozzarella. Or the Salada de Maca with romaine, apples, cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, and balsamic dressing. Price: Lunch Special- any 1/2 sandwich or pizza slice with a side salad or soup $6.99 Best Coffee : Texas Coffee Trader s 1400 E. 4 th St. Texas Coffee Traders is quite possible my favorite place to visit on the Eastside . Often overlooked due to the fact that it's housed in a warehouse, this place is not to be missed. A Disneyland for the coffee connoisseur, Texas Coffee Traders has rows and rows of unique coffee to taste and buy. Typically a place to get your coffee in bulk, the friendly staff will fix you up a cup of cappuccino or tea while you wait. However, this year for SXSW, the store will be setting up a coffee stand on the corner of 4th and Navasota, so make sure to check them out! These guys will remind you of why you love Austin. Most Romantic: Justine's 4710 E. 5 th St. Justine's is relatively new to the Eastside , but a wonderful addition. Situated in an old house, the ambiance of Justine's is quaint and warm. One enters below a vintage neon sign onto a front yard draped with string lights and tables. Inside the dark wood and vaulted ceiling of the house make for a cozy atmosphere. Justine's is a great place to grab a drink or dine in. Inspired by French cuisine, my favorites include the Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade (endives, rouqefort , walnuts, and pear) and the Steak Tartare . Price: Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade $8.50, Steak Tartare $14 Most Metropolitan: East Side Show Room 1100 E. 6 th St. East Side Show Room is also a relatively new to the Eastside . Channeling a 1920's feel, the bar/restaurant showcases vintage furniture and fixtures, local art, and some of the best lighting in town. East Side Show Room is also one of the best places to see and be seen these days. The menu is a little steep, but definitely creative and delicious. Their curried grits and greens is a must, as is their Barbequed Quail and Oranges. Price: Curried Grits &amp; Greens $9, Barbequed Quail &amp; Oranges $18 Most Chill: Rio Rita 1308 E. 6 th St. Rio Rita has quickly become of of my favorite hangout spots on the Eastside . Cafe by day, lounge by night, this funky bar looks like an explosion went off in a vintage furniture store. Rio Rita serves a collection of local food, infused vodkas, and mystery beers. On Monday night you can listen to your own 45 for \"Love and a 45\" night or bring your crayons and glue for \"Arts and Drafts\" night on Thursdays. This is definitely a great place to kick back and mingle with the quirkiest of the bunch. Price: Ham &amp; Brie sandwich $6.50, Turkey &amp; Cranberry on a Croissant $6.50 Photo source: Yelp.com Do you have that one dress, one pair of hot pants, or that one hat that always compels people to stop you, grab you arm, and say in a low voice, \"Where on Earth did you get that?\" Well I just found me a pair of socks that garnered lots of comments at Whole Foods yesterday ('cause you have to look good when you go to Whole Foods). And an awkward run-in with a security guard at Wells Fargo. The security guard was sitting on a bench, and I think she quietly said, \"I like your boots\" (meaning she liked my awesome kick-ass lace-up slippers) as I walked by. I didn't quite hear what she said, so I turned and gave a slight smile. The sort of smile that says, \"I have no idea if you were talking to me or not, but here, here is a half smile to sort of acknowledge what you said\". I started obsessing over whether or not she was talking to me and I started to sweat. I wanted to walk up to her and say, \"Thank you!\", but the time for that had past and I started to rock back and forth in line. When I left the bank and nodded to her, she stared at me stone-faced and I was convinced that she now hated me for giving her a half-ass smile in return for her very sweet compliment. So you wanna know what socks will get you compliments at Whole Foods and awkward Larry David-like situations at banks? The Lacy Lace-up Slipper Socks by Sock Theory . The best part? They're $7. They also come in white. Make sure to check out Sock Theory' s broad collection of unique socks, leg warmers, arm warmers, knee-highs, and panty-hose. Definitely my new favorite online store. Here are few pics of me wearing my new lace-up's. I had to cut my head out because the sun was so bright yesterday, between my squinting and scrunched up mouth while squinting, I looked like what would happen if Renee Zellweger and Sloth procreated. Also, I don't shine my shoes. Obs. First post in my Austin, TX series for SXSW It's that time of year again. The time of year where you stock up on your Adderall or Xanax or Xantac or horse tranquilizers and set your Facebook tagged photos to private. South by Southwest Interactive and Film will be starting this Friday, with the music portion beginning next Wednesday. What does that mean for you? That means your chances of getting drunk with Bill Murrary or hooking up with a hipster from Brooklyn who is in a band with the words \"bear\", \"deer\", \"neon\", \"gold\", or \"black\" in it have just improved. If you're new to Austin, here is a list of traits that make our town so unique. Come and join the fun! 1.) The entire city collectively waits with bated breath for the Groupon of the day. 2.) At anytime in anyplace, your chances of hearing New Order playing on the sound system are 2 to 1. 3.) We treat music festivals like national holidays (and we really don't have a choice). 4.) Overhear conversations that start with, (person looking at their Iphone), \"Oh, looks like Brooklyn Vegan is following me on Twitter. Cool.\" (overhear= I said it yesterday). 5.) Facebook comments like, \"There is a little kids choir singing Flaming Lips and Wilco at my place of employment right now.\" 6.) Every single person has a mustache and we have competitions once a month to see who has the best. Photo by Alison Narro 7.) A 24 hour pecan vending machine in the middle of nowhere. 8.) We eat migas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and we can tell you exactly where in town the best migas are located. 9.) The rivers in Austin are made of beer and you can often find us knelt in the river bed, stuffing our goard like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka. 10.) We quietly judge each other on the make of our bicycles and nothing else. 11.) The older and more worn your clothing is, the more street cred you have. 12.) We do a lot of our business out of Airstream trailers. Mostly for aesthetic purposes. The South by Southwest Festival in Austin, TX will be starting this Friday. I plan on devoting most of the week to Austin and SXSW posts. However, I haven't written a single thing yet! In the meantime, please enjoy this gallery of Maurizio Cattelan's work. I learnt of Cattelan this weekend while in Houston. The Menil Collection is currently exhibiting some of his pieces. I'm still brewing what I think about him. What are your thoughts? You have nine followers, and one of them is your mother. You wonder why the hell you're even blogging. You speculate if anyone will ever read your words. You ponder if life is worth living. Well look no further! Listed below are twelve sure-fire ways to drive traffic to your blog and instantly boost your self-worth. 1.) Join Blogging Network Sites - The best blog networking website is Twenty-Something Bloggers. Hands down. Joining 20sb opened up a whole new world for me. Before then, I had no idea how to discover other blogs. 20sb is a supportive and strong community of like-minded bloggers. I can't recommend it enough. Other blogging networks include Blog Lovin ', Blog Her , BlogCatalog , and My Blog Log . 2.) Write Interesting Content - As much as want to go into great detail about your recent trip to the dentist or how you wrapped your Christmas gifts, refrain from it. Truthfully, nobody cares. Unless the dentist had a boner while performing your root canal or you lobbed off your finger while cutting wrapping paper for you gifts...then we might be interested. Humor is a guaranteed way to enter the hearts of millions. Take for example Hyperbole-and-a-Half . You could learn a lot from her. 3.) Write About A Trend Topic - I don't adhere to this rule at all, but it's definitely a way to create buzz on your blog. Commenting on the cultural importance of \"Jersey Shore\" or how Justin Bieber looks like he should be on the \"L Word\" is a good way to start a convo. 4.) Befriend Other Bloggers - The blogging community is a tight-knit one. I have met people that I'm convinced sat next to me at the Algonquin Roundtable in another life. These people have encouraged me to grow as a writer and have supported and advertised my work. I wouldn't be where I am today without them and I try to do the same for them. As The Beatles once said, \"The love you take is equal to the love you make\". 5.) Leave Comments - Bloggers love comments like Mickey Rourke loves ghastly printed button-ups. Our self-esteem begins to slowly hinge on how many comments are left on our blog a day. If you comment on our blog, we will love you forever and most likely return the favor. 6.) Brand Yourself- The general consensus on this seems to be \"yucky\", but I disagree. The more polished the blog is, the greater the chance a reader will take it more seriously, no? Having a \"brand\" shows the world that you are legit. Does it take away from the personal aspect of blogging? Sometimes. But this is where you have to get clever in how you brand yourself. Subliminal branding. 7.) Photos! - Photos are a win-win all 'round. Photos grab attention. Photos can often work in substitute of text (Tumblr?). Photos can inspire. I try to put a picture in every single one of my posts, even if it's not necessary. Like a picture of my ass. 8.) Lists - We seem to really like lists. They're easy to read and typically very visual. Remember, the average internet reader's attention span is like 45 seconds (I made that up). It's kind of true though. Think of some of your favorite posts on Buzzfeed or EW.com . Short and sweet lists. 9.) Connect With Your Audience- One of the most talked ideas running through the marketing world these days is Lady Gaga's rise to fame due in part to her fan interaction and loyalty. DoDo like GaGa. Also, the blogs that appear to have the most comments are blogs where the writer shares a part of him/herself with the readers in the post, then interacts with them via the comment box. Personal is good, but don't forget rule #2. 10.) Self Promote, But Only 20% Of The Time - Nobody likes a showoff. However, who is going to know about your blog if you don't say anything? I know some very humble bloggers who haven't even told anyone that they have a blog! You have to walk a fine line here. Tweet or FB that you have a new post up, but don't send personal messages to strangers telling them to check out your blog. Nobody likes that. In fact, we'll purposely not go check out your blog. 11.) Believe That Your Traffic Will Go Up- I know it can get discouraging at times, but don't give up. People want to hear what you have to say. If you believe that your blog will be successful, it most likely will. Power of suggestion. 12.) Post a Picture of Your Ass Keep me posted on your progress! I'm curious to hear."}

{"id": "bag-2082", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "So I suppose I should consider my rock star lifestyle is catching up with me. I had some sick-ass awesome insomnia in middle and high school (which ultimately lead to amazing creations and major advancement in my art due to lack of better things to do) and it's been back for the past few days or so. I just can't sleep at night, and by the time the sun comes around I'm so awake it's beyond me. I've been catching naps before work, but I'm not sure if that's helping. Maybe it's all the stress.\n\nBut what stress? I got my car back the other day, so that's great news. I got a kick ass assistant helping me find a new pad by the end of the month, and I have a nice new addition to my life *(more on that later- I can't disclose who or what it is. Not a baby tho. Cause fuck, we all know I would fuck that up).\n\nAnyway- the point is I can't sleep at night. The only time I'm tired is from 6pm to midnight for some god fucking unreasonable reason that is a complete mystery. Wtf am I suppose to do about it? I tried to take a nap on Friday and I slept through the entire shift on accident.\n\nThis is sorta but not unlike those three weeks where I woke up every day at seven fucking am in the morning. No reason didn't matter how much prior sleep, just 7am- eyes open, and always very hungry. I thought about getting some early ass day job to fill the time.\n\nI'm so exhausted staring at this screen at my 26th hour of awakeness. I know that if I shut my eyes I'll just be awake at 12am and the whole shitty process starts over again. Especially because I have to be some fucking where at 4pm.\n\nMy brain acts like a wild teen independent of my will.\n\nOh yea. I almost forgot- I totally found my \"sports injury cream\" and I'll be rubbing the shit out of my knees with it. Sweet sweet pain relief. They were starting to scare me with the \"popping\" sounds and discomfort. I can feel safe in the fact this is 2010 though, so robot knee technology is just around the corner."}

Pictures I took back when my hair was blonde and there was snow outside and I wasn't all lazy and in a style rut like now. Any ideas as to what a story to them could be? I haven't the slightest idea. Today in school we played dodgeball. Or, rather, I played dodgeball, and everyone else played kickball. But then they were all \"NOO COME ON YOU CAN'T BE THAT BAD\" and I was like \"HAHAH THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK\" and then they made me kick it and I ran to the wrong base. Actually, I didn't even run to a base, I just ran to this random mat that I thought was a base, but was just IN THE WAY, and POINTLESS, kind of like the interpretive dancing at the Oscars. But you know what would've made this experiment far less painful? IF I HAD BEEN WEARING THIS: Along with paying a visit to the 60's (my favorite era, which is probably some kind of twist of FATE) (see what I did there? Bob Dylan song? 60's?) (Oh wait, that song is actually 70's. I...fail. Anyway.) Miu Miu was almost cartoonish with its giant bows, poppy colors, scallops, exaggerated pocket piping, and shoe skirts that added an extra clunky stomping factor to the overall effect. And there were LOTS of embellishments with metallic bows and flowers, kind of as if the wearer was a little girl going through her grandma's jewelry box (from when grand mam mam had her 60's heydey) and sort of decorating herself with brooches. It started out with the bright colors and cartoon-ish lace (which I will now refer to as the little sister of Prada's ) but towards the end got to a place that was darker, a different kind of romantic, slightly stark.. The silhouettes, colors, and fabrics became more sophisticated, and the playful, wiry flower brooches were replaced by some in full bloom. There were parts I didn't care for or that wouldn't have really improved today's game of kickball, (which is now the new standard for everything: would it improve my pitiful, athletically-challenged middle school experiences? WOULD IT?) such as the low cut-overall situations and skirts-over-pants (maybe because I was too reminded of my 3rd grade days when I decided I was really edgy and //alt for wearing a skirt over a pair of jeans. THE MEMORIES, MAKE THEM STOPPPPPP). They didn't feel out of place in the collection but my sentiments for them were those of Enid's here: The spring collection will always be my favorite, and that kind of magic can't happen twice. But over all, it was cute and fun and Miu Miu. And it still would've made that really awful game of kickball much, much better. Prada Fall 2008 / Miu Miu Fall 2010. Hussein Chalayan was based around the idea of a mirage, though that fact was no MIRAGE as the sunglasses said, \"MIRAGE\". Dad jokes! In all seriousness, because this is serious business, as things always are around here, I first thought it was sort of arbitrary, but the more I looked through it and thought about it the more it made sense, and the fact that it was hard to understand at first only made me like it more. And made it more, of course, like a mirage. I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, MR. CHALAYAN. There were binoculars stuffed up with shearling and leather, hazy nebula-like prints, foggy sheer fabrics, and crocheted jackets that only half-covered the top part of the body. Without the concept, the clothes didn't seem to flow from one look to another too well, but I don't think a Hussein Chalayan collection can be viewed without knowing that there has to be a concept, anyway. The \"mirage\" sunglasses reminded me of New Year's Eve sunglasses, in a good way. I am not normally one for red carpet dressing (other than the CFDA gala) and last night we didn't even get Tilda or Cate, AND the co-hosting was awkward, AND Twilight is not a horror movie, and Zac Efron STILL HIGHLY RESEMBLES A NEOPET, but Carey Mulligan filled the Prada void that would have been otherwise occupied by Tilda with this dress that looks very pretty and normal at first... But then when you look at a closer picture, you see this, and if you happen to be looking at the closer picture while it's really late and night and you just ate/drank your weight in sugary products, your reaction is 3x the excitement, or, UDISGHDSLUGWHUIWGSD Tiny kitchen utensils! For tiny murderers! Chick is basically wearing a Clue gameboard, AND IT IS FANTASTIC. And Robert Downey Jr. looked awesome. I would like to think that he and Michelle Obama play kickball together in their matching Lanvin sneakers. WELL DONE, SHERLOCK, WELL DONE. That's about it. Again, don't really care for red carpet-type stuff BUT throw some tiny knives and bow ties into the mix and I am intrigued. Oh, and TOM FORD. Throw Tom Ford into the mix and I am also intrigued, and also maybe sitting two inches away from the screen, never mind that it is in the corner of the room hanging from a ceiling. I use my floating powers when necessary, okay? Lastly, I love you all more than rainbows. Vivienne Westwood was like a Maurice Sendak character that runs away to start her own kingdom, AKA, what I would like to do, all the time, a lot. Paper crowns, crayon scribbles (some of which read \"Prince Charming\") and drapy dresses that could've come out of an older sister's dress-up box..plus, only Vivs could put her models in marker moustaches (time for me to revisit TOMAS , perhaps?) and it still make sense. And, going back to the Maurice Sendak thing: Wild Rumpus crowns, anyone? That star on that grey sweatshirt is TOTALLY Really Rosie? LIFE COMPLETE. At the Independent Fashion Bloggers conference at NYFW, there was a panel including the Fashionista girls, Susie Bubble , Phil Oh , Bryanboy , and myself, and we talked about-WAIT FOR IT- the future of fashion blogging ! Pretty RANDOM topic, if you ask me. There's a video but I'm too afraid to watch it because I probably said some stupid things. But! If I were to paraphrase, I would say we mostly talked about: -Discretion when it comes to accepting gifts or freebies. -Advice to new bloggers. (Which mostly came to: write about what is interesting to you. What works for one blogger doesn't always work for another, and writing about the exact same stuff that a popular blogger writes about will go unnoticed since someone else is already doing the same thing.) -A blogger's place at Fashion Week. -Hey, remember when we all decided we were the greatest people ever and that blogs were the new everything? Me neither! The media likes the story but it ain't no big thang. -We can't predict the future of fashion blogging. The same way no one saw it coming, no one knows where it will go. The big difference between bloggers and journalists isn't the fact that we're using computers. I mean, Cathy Horyn and Lynn Yaeger have blogs, lots of critics write for style.com, and a number of editors, including Hamish Bowles and Andre Leon Talley, write blog posts; but it's not the same as my having a blog - the difference is experience. It's not remarkable that we're using the internet!!! but what most people are pointing out - with me, mostly, since this doesn't apply to the other bloggers that were on the panel - is lack of experience. I haven't gone to journalism school, I haven't had any internships, etc. And I'm 13, which, oh my God, I can't tell you how excited I am to outgrow that number. This, honestly, is what I think is the future of fashion blogging, or at least part of it. The same way teenagers can start a Flickr account and be noticed by a magazine, or a band can start a MySpace and be picked up by a label, blogs will act as jumping-off platforms for people that want to work in the industry. When I started Style Rookie in March of 2008, only ElleGirl and teenvogue.com would write about blogs. It wasn't a big media thing and having one wasn't an affiliation for Fashion Week, it was a nice circle of ladies and occasional dudes who supported each other and often found themselves saying \"Thank you for this post! None of my friends get my feelings about ______.\" Then some of us started taking opportunities that had arisen, and I spent some money on a Hussein Chalayan dress, and then all of a sudden it was like, JUDAAAAAAAAAAS. Which is, you know, bizarre. Allow me to direct you to this epic Dave Eggers essay . So now my inbox and comment section are full of \"Can you critique my blog? Can you tell me what to do to get invited to shows? How do I get my blog recognized in the industry?\" which isn't a bad thing, I guess (other than the critiquing thing, which like..it's about you and your thoughts. No one is able to tell you what to think or how to explain your thinking to others.) Now blogging is a full-time job for some people and in some cases a segway into the industry but I guess that's the way it goes. And it's sort of a bummer, especially because now I'm far more aware of the number of people that read my blog, and when I take this into consideration when writing a post I feel pressured to sound smarter or fancier when mostly I just enjoy writing journal-like streams of thought (my blog has always been a virtual diary) even though I'm supposed to be writing grand reviews because a newspaper or magazine told whoever to expect that. That's a problem with my own outlook, though, and I still enjoy blogging. A lot. And, thankfully, it doesn't have to be a job for me. When it starts to feel like one, I'll stop. But I don't think anyone is saying blogs are the equivalent to magazines, or inexperienced bloggers like myself are the equivalent to journalists, anyway. Still, there is nothing wrong with having a range of perspectives. I think fashion is important to discuss. Which brings me to this recent Isabel Marant quotation: \u201cFor me, fashion shows are not for the public, they are trade shows for the press. It\u2019s time for the press to understand the collection and then spread the information. That\u2019s more interesting than just the image. Everyone wants to be first. It\u2019s too too much. There should be privacy and mystery. There is no excitement about anything anymore as everything is available immediately and all the time \u2013 you don\u2019t have to wait for anything. I don\u2019t like the idea of being flooded with image and information. I don\u2019t belong to the generation of spending time on the internet. I think it\u2019s too fast and too fake. It\u2019s like going to a museum on the internet \u2013 where is the pleasure? It\u2019s sad because everyone is running after everything, but after what? Everything is too quick. There is no room in your heads for all this information. No one retains anything.\u201d I think that when it comes to fashion shows being online, it's exposure for a brand. I think that a customer deserves to see the show and get to know the world of that label. I like privacy and mystery too, but there's a fine line between that and exclusivity. And-TWIST!-I also hate the fastness of the Internet! And the fakeness! I like buying my magazines and zines and having special stuff I can hold in my hand! And this Internet, it makes the already fast fashion very very fast! And it's scary and a lot of it feels very unauthentic and sad. And fast. But, in five years, the iPhone will be Oldy McOldster from Oldsville, Oldesota. And tumblr then will be like xanga now. Who knows where fashion blogging will be. Point is, things are changing. \"Classics with a twist!\" Retro futurism! In fashion, all those cliches have been done time and again, but I think that Nicolas Ghesquiere's collection for Balenciaga was the only one as of recent to elevate these concepts to a level that was more refined and thoughtful. \"Retro futurism\" didn't mean the Jetsons, and \"classics\" didn't mean camel coats or button-downs. They were elements of home-living and domesticity that were brought into the present with what has now become Nicolas LongName's signature futurism aesthetic. He said his goal was \"to ennoble every day objects.\" Mission accomplished. Ew, that makes me think of Tom Cruise, which makes me think of him jumping on Oprah's couch. And we don't like to talk about that here. So instead I will say, \"A+\"! But that makes me think of school, and it is the weekend, so we don't like to talk about that here, either. Gosh, is there a reason that there isn't a way to say \"GOOD JOB\" without being reminded of something terribly disturbing? Well...I guess I could always just say \"good job.\" So, um, good job, Nicky G! (Why do I think this much about these things?) ANYWAY. Futuristic classics! Right! On the far left and far right, updated versions of quilting. The texture on the nude dress reminded me of doilies or lace napkins, and a simple wool sweater was brought into the future with bright green, sort of geometric threading (which really makes me think of that one lily pad game from Zoombinis . In a good way!) The shoes (which were totally killer) were the greatest indication of this - oxfords or loafers or a wood-looking material elevated with geometric shapes and of what looked like minerals (and whose patterns and colors reminded me a lot of Snood . WHY IS THIS COLLECTION THE SUMMARY OF OUR FAMILY COMPUTER'S ACTIVITY FROM THE YEARS 2002-2005?) The closing looks were WORDS. Lots of em. Some looked like newspaper or tabloid headlines, and some were in electric clock fonts. In a few looks, they were attached to and appeared to be pouring out of the skinny-legged pants, and in others, were printed on ninja star-shaped marshmallows held together by their corners. I couldn't figure out what this was getting at, but have a feeling it has to do with bringing communication to a new medium. HA. Yeah, that's all I got. As a look, I dig it, though. There were then pieces that weren't so obviously on the same wavelength as the collection's concept when broken down, but still felt just as modern. Palettes from Spring were updated , grey coats like the one below were simple as silhouettes but calmly assertive. Same goes for the textural pants mixed with humble striped sweaters. Also? That dress next to the lil orange number? Needs to be styled with sheer Rodarte AW10 pants? Because it would look pretty and what I say goes? GOOD."}

When I\u2019m alone, I\u2019m plugged into my iPod. When I\u2019m with a friend, we talk. A walk is a walk is a walk\u2026until I walked with Claire. \n\nThe girl doesn\u2019t know it, but she always knows exactly what to do and say to put things in perspective. \n\nThis morning we decided to walk uptown to the post office and library. She put on her Dora sneakers and tan jacket, and I surprised her with new purple mittens with hearts and rainbows I bought her on winter clearance. This made her very happy. \n\nI put on my pink backpack loaded with the envelopes that needed to be mailed, my phone and some money since I was pretty sure I had library fines to reconcile. Claire put on her Dora backpack. \n\nThe weather was lovely \u2013 sunny and about 40 degrees when we started walking. Sidewalks are inconsistent for the first few blocks, so we cut down an alley to avoid street traffic. As we passed a garage, Claire asked, \u201cWhere\u2019d my shadow go?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat, honey?\u201d I asked. \n\nShe stopped. \u201cMy shadow, Grammy.\u201d \n\nShadow? But of course! I haven\u2019t thought about my shadow since I was a kid, except to maybe avoid looking at it when I was obese. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hidden by the garage,\u201d I told her. \u201cLet\u2019s move back into the sunshine.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere it is! It\u2019s big!\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a big shadow, too, Grammy!\u201d and she waved. \u201cSee my hand?\u201d\n\nI waved back with both hands. She giggled.\n\n\u201cI see your fingers in the shadow,\u201d she said. \n\nWhen we turned the corner we were back on a sidewalk and our shadows were in front of us. Claire hopped over each crack for the rest of the block, thrilled that her shadow kept up with her. \n\nWe got to a corner at which we had to cross a street. I was holding her hand and was just going to walk her across when it dawned on me that I could teach her how to properly cross a street. \n\n\u201cAlways stop before walking out on to the street,\u201d I said. \u201cLook to your left. Do you see a car coming?\u201d\n\nLooking very concentrated, she peered down the street. \u201cNo,\u201d she said seriously.\n\n\u201cNow look to your right. Any cars?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d \n\n\u201cOK, that means we can cross safely.\u201d \n\nWe walked down a street I\u2019ve walked for years, but I\u2019d never really noticed that the Purinton\u2019s house was blue or the rental next door had green trim until Claire pointed it out. Then she spied tiny purple flowers in the next yard. \n\n\u201cOooo! Those are crocuses,\u201d I told her. \n\n\u201cCrocheches,\u201d she repeated. Close enough. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have noticed them on an ordinary walk. I notice them in my own yard because I\u2019m looking for them, but crocuses are even better when you\u2019re not seeking them out and spectacular when you unexpectedly get to introduce them to a 2-year-old who loves the colors purple and green. \n\n\u201cI run real fast, Grammy!\u201d and she took off. I kept up by walking more briskly, but it was fun to let her get to the next house a little before I did. \n\nWe were getting close to another corner and she took my hand. We stopped, she looked both ways, and we walked safely across. \n\nWe went to the post office first, which is next door to the library. I handed the envelopes to the mail clerk. Claire said, \u201cI want to see,\u201d so I lifted her up to sit on the counter. \n\n\u201cI like your mittens,\u201d said the clerk. Claire\u2019s shy and so she just smiled and looked down at the hearts and rainbows. \n\n\u201cCan she have a lollipop?\u201d he whispered to me. I nodded. \n\n\u201cWould you like a lollipop?\u201d he asked Claire.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said rather boldly, and I thought, Yeah, I\u2019ve always preferred candy over compliments, too. \n\nShe reached in the bag and pulled out a small chocolate flavored Tootsie-Pop. She\u2019s definitely my granddaughter. \n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d I asked her. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said staring at her mittens again, but he heard her. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said. \n\nShe insisted I open the wrapper before we left the post office and I didn\u2019t want her to bring it into the library, so we sat on a bench out front and she ate her lollipop. \n\n\u201cA black truck,\u201d she pointed to the street. \u201cThat\u2019s Papa\u2019s truck.\u201d Her dad\u2019s dad is Papa and drives a pickup. \n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not Papa\u2019s truck, but it looks like it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a red car,\u201d she continued and crunched her lollipop. \n\n\u201cHear that?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a blue jay,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cBlue jay,\u201d she repeated and took another bite of her lollipop.\n\nWatching Claire observe the world around her \u2013 the world I\u2019ve very much taken for granted \u2013 this Ting-Tings song came into my head: \n\nThey call me girl\nThey call me Stacey\nThey call me her\nThey call me Jane\n\n\nThat\u2019s not my name\nThat\u2019s not my name\nThat\u2019s not my name\nThat\u2019s not my name\n\nThey can call me Emily. They can call me Shawna. But that\u2019s not my name. I\u2019m Grammy. I\u2019m Mom. I\u2019m Lynn. I know who I am. I know how I lost weight. I could spend all kinds of money fighting these bogus websites illegally using my images only to find other sites doing the same thing. Or I can let it go and live in the world around me. My real world. \n\nI have a shadow. The crocuses are blooming. I\u2019m teaching Claire how to cross the street and what a blue jay sounds like. People can believe what they want about my images. I know what\u2019s true. Nothing else matters."}

It has a population of almost 60,000 and is known for its traditional sandals (huraches) and hats (sombreros). The name Sahuayo is from the N\u00e1huatl language, and has been interpreted as several different things; however, the favoured definition as translated by Dr. Don Antonio Pe\u00f1afiel, is that is composed of two elements: tzacual and ayoti. Tzacual is an earthenware vessel shaped by half of a coconut and ayoti means turtle. Thus 'Sahuayo is 'a pot that looks like a turtle'. The turtle is the symbol of Sahuayo."}

They'd been bumps there forever and they finally made their way through. Can I tell you how hard it is to catch those two little teeth on camera though? Very hard. This is as close as I got:\nAnd yes, Jeremy is holding him upside down so I could get this. Luckily Eli thought that was a blast. The left one came in first and a couple days later, the right one joined in. Very exciting. And it looks like there are several more also on their way. Fun fun!\n\nNext up: crawling. Eli took his first few real forward crawls today (crawls? they're not steps; i don't know what you call them). He's been scooting, rolling, army crawling, getting on his hands and knees, going backward, and so forth, but today we saw the first glimpses of the real deal. He takes a few crawls (again, that sounds so weird) and then drops to his tummy again for the army crawl, but I'm sure he will be crawling the length of our house in no time. :) I managed to catch a bit of it on video (please ignore my encouraging sounds - I hate hearing myself on video, but I forget to shut my mouth when I press record; and it's really short because I ran out of memory).\n \nAnd last but not least...no more pacifier! At least I think so. It seems like I got off way too easy, so I'm not sure if we've really seen the end of it here, but it appears so. I usually only would give Eli his pacifier when he went to sleep and when we were at church (they should call it a \"muter\"); oh, and sometimes when I teach lessons. Anyway, but lately he has refused it at bed time so I just stopped giving it to him and he hasn't seemed to miss it at all! I was planning on trying to wean him from it soon anyway, but I certainly didn't think it would be this easy. Here's hoping it's really over! I should just throw them away and then it really will be over...hmm. We'll see.\n\nSo that's the update! This boy's changing fast! He pulls himself up to stand a lot now too. It's so fun to see him growing up. He'll be running around by the time the warm summer weather gets here. Yea!!!"}
