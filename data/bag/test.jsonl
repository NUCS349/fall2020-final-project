It should also be said that I don't mean to discount the devastation of war to people and property. There is a difference between choosing to build parking lots and having your life and possessions destroyed. First Rotterdam: This from scientific psychic: And this from the special collections of the Wageningen Library: Next Houston: Clearance of housing to build US59 via TexasFreeway.com , an amazing resource if you want to see how freeways were built in Texas.

Finally, where Union Station used to be is where highway 59 rockets through on the east side of downtown and Minute Maid park now exists with a token train filled with oranges. Wire Feed More! That's the scream of merchants and others who believe that a downtown without an endless sea of parking is not worth going to. But once the whole downtown turns into a parking lot it's not really worth much anymore is it? Yet we still see the discussion of parking dominate without an eye for the destruction that it can cause a downtown if left unfettered. Before Portland's miraculous return as an urban Mecca, it too was once infested by parking. So was the city of Houston, where parking lots took over most of the downtown at one point. Via Mike Lydon &amp; Transit Miami (Via the book City Shaped) Perhaps you can say how different this is from Rotterdam after German bombing... It's unfortunate that we didn't see what we were doing to our wonderful cities in the name of cars first. Europe had war, yet we dismantled our cities in a similar way in the name of progress. So much parking though, what has that done to the city's value? What has it taken away in terms of tax revenue from land and greater employment agglomerations? A study by Anne Moudon and Dohn Wook Sohn showed that offices that were clustered had greater values than those that weren't in the Seattle region. In addition to the spending on highways that expanded our regions to their current far reaches, how much real estate value did we destoy? Greater value for downtowns was lost and in the process we saw places like Hartford, as found by Dr. Norm Garrick at UConn lose population, employment, and their character. Not just the loss from parking, but from the gutting of the city by the Interstate System. Here are some slides from Dr. Garrick showing the destruction. When he toggled through the first time, the room I was in audibly gasped for air. Hartford Pre Interstate Hartford Post Interstate So what's the damage? The amount of tax creating employment did not grow and parking spots skyrocketed. So in aggregate what did this look like? The red shows it all: Lost revenue, lost agglomeration, lost value.

I just didn't know how big a U.S victory would be.\n\nFor obvious reasons, this was Canada's game to win. And after watching both teams play their first few games, I figured the Canadians, with the clear advantage in star power, wouldn't have trouble disposing of a much younger, inexperienced American team by 2-3 goals.\n\nBut in my mind there was only one handicap Canada could have given Team USA: Marty Brodeur. They played him in goal, and it cost them big-time.\n\nDon't get me wrong\u2014there's no doubt that Brodeur is one of the best goaltenders to have ever played the game. Here's a brief glimpse of his killer resume:\nThe NHL's all-time leader in regular season wins, shutouts, and games played\nMore than 30 franchise records, including most all-time regular season and playoff wins, shutouts, games, and lowest goals-against average\n3 Stanley Cup championships\nFour-time Vezina Trophy winner, four-time Jennings Trophy winner, 10-time NHL All Star, and a Calder Memorial Trophy winner\nOne of only two NHL goaltenders to have scored goals in both the regular season and the playoffs; the only NHL goalie to score a game-winning goal.\nBrodeur is known for his hybrid goaltending style by standing up more than butterfly goalies, who drop to their knees often. It's gotten him this far, and even at his veteran age of 38, I'd still take him over half the goalies in the NHL.\n\nBut when I've watched Brodeur play periodically in the past few years, he's given up questionable goals, mostly as a result of his unconventional style of play. During this relatively new generation of super-athletic, butterfly-sliding goalies, Brodeur has become outdated. But don't take that as an insult, Marty\u2014you've been incredibly successful as New Jersey's starting netminder for the past 19 seasons.\n\nCanada started Roberto Luongo in net for their opening Olympic game against Norway. Apparently coach Mike Babcock planned on going with the more-experienced Brodeur as his No. 1 for the tournament, but wanted to get Luongo's skates wet in case he needed to call on him later. But instead of anticipating sub-par play from his starting goalie, Babcock should have stuck with Luongo (an All Star in his own right, playing on his home ice), similar to how the Team USA coach Ron Wilson preselected Ryan Miller to play the entire way. Babcock handed the reins over to Brodeur against Switzerland in the second game.\n\nHad Luongo played against Team USA on Sunday night, I'm not so sure so many Americans would have been celebrating. I say this chiefly because the 6'3\" butterflyer would have stopped the goals that Brodeur let in. And this goes back to what I was saying before: Brodeur may have been a better goalie five years ago, but Luongo is now."}

Angry protestors I did not find. But was Angers crippled by these strikes or not? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWhen walking into down, it did appear to me that it felt a bit quieter than normal. There did not seem to be same number of cars which there normally are through the city centre. There were fewer buses running today in Angers, but not to the extent where there were no buses. There seemed to be adequate buses running and on the buses there did not seem to be crushes of people trying to get anywhere.\n\nMoving into the town, no shops or banks were closed. It did not seem that any of Angers\u2019 banks were closed.\n\nThe main thing which I found in the town was an increase in children. When walking into town, I noticed that the school near where I live was closed: I could see chairs on tables in the building. In town, it was evident that schools and colleges were closed. In the centre of town there were college students skateboarding in the central square, which usually happens only at weekends.\n\nMoreover, there were many mothers with their children in town today. Seemingly trying to find something to do with them. Many times I saw a mother with one or two children with her. Also I came across a snake of 20 or so 4 or 5 year olds being looked after two or three women. Seemingly not enough of them to look after the children who they were looking after.\n\nAlso I came across a group of 14/15 year olds walking through town, about 25/30 of them, obviously not at school today, on a kind of shopping trip instead, all of them with H&M bags.\n\nThe amount of children and teenagers in the town centre obviously meant that many educational establishments were today closed today.\n\nI then went across town to check out what was happening at the station. On the face of things you wouldn\u2019t know anything was wrong. All the cancelled trains appear to have been taken off the departure board to hide the problems perhaps.

{"id": "bag-1343", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "Last week, Hard Assets Investor published another one of my articles . In it, I compared the correlations between several energy ETFs and the prices of commodities they are tracking. The takeaway message is that, for the most part, ETFs do a bad job tracking commodities prices. There are a few reasons for this. The first, and primary reason why the correlation is less than perfect, is that the front-month futures contract for every commodity is constantly changing. Since most ETFs hold only the front-month contract, this means that sometime before expiration, the fund must sell its holding of one (soon to expire) contract and then purchase another (soon to be front-month) contract. There is almost always a significant discrepency between the two prices, particularly if it's a commodity that doesn't deliver every month. Take a look at the futures chains on the CME group website for crude oil , gold , and corn . As of writing, the difference between the front month and second month contract is about 40\u00a2, $1, and 10\u00a2, respectively. That may not seem like much, but that price difference represents a pure loss in the value of the fund with every roll that takes place. Just to prevent declines, the fund would, on average, have to be increasing in value between 1 and 5% a month. That means that, depending on the commodity and the fund, a monthly percentage increase, if not sufficiently high, may actually mean you're losing money. The second problem with ETFs is that they create a secondary market on top of what is already a volatile market in its own right. And, while the underlying instruments are the same for both, (futures contracts) the factors driving the supply and demand may be drastically different. For example, while natural gas might be moving up on strong demand resulting from a particular weather forecast , if the primary participants are energy hedgers, no such demand would exist for UNG, the world's biggest natural gas etf. As such, UNG might theoretically follow the price of gas with something of a lag, rather than actually track the price in real time. Don't take my word for it, take a look at this graph comparing oil price movements with the price of USO, the world's biggest crude oil ETF, over the last four years: Click here to download Flash Player now View the full Crude vs USO chart at Wikinvest Now, you might be saying \"those charts seem to follow each other reasonably well\" but that's the problem. Reasonably well isn't good enough. An investor buying a share or shares in a commodity ETF that puportedly tracks the price of a commodity wants her investment to actually do just that, not merely track the price \"reasonably well\". It's true that there are some ETFs, especially those dealing with precious metals, that eliminate the problem of the roll yield altogether simply by buying and hoarding the commodity in question and storing it in a vault somewhere; no futures contracts required. While certainly effective in mitigating the problem, this only works for a very specific subset of commodities that do not have a cliff for their usefulness. Other than those few cases, in general, the moral is that if you really, truly want exposure to commodities, don't waste your time with an ETF. As they stand, very few of them can be relied upon to achieve their goals. Though that may change in the future, for now, your best bet is get into the futures market directly. Last week, a couple of the major commodities exchanges announced the addition of some new futures contracts to help producers and consumers of raw goods hedge their expenses, and simultaneously give commodities traders three more reasons to develop stress-related ulcers. First, across the pond, the world's foremost metals market, the London Metal Exchange (LME) yesterday opened trading of cobalt and molybdenum futures. In shocking concordance with my previous post about the emerging need for a lithium futures contract , the cobalt contract is designed specifically with battery manufacturers in mind, cobalt being a major input to rechargeable batteries in things like laptops and cellphones. Molybdenum, which I had never heard of before this Wall Street Journal article , is apparently used in the production of stainless steel. Meanwhile, here in the States, the ever-growing Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that it will be adding a contract for distiller's dried grain (DDG), a by-product of corn ethanol production. This is interesting because, with the addition of the contract, which will begin trading in April, ethanol producers can now effectively hedge every step of their production. For example, before the harvest you might buy a corn contract so as to protect yourself from unexpected price swings at your local grain elevator. Then, once you've got your corn and begin distilling ethanol, you can sell both a DDG and ethanol contract to lock in prices for your two resultant byproducts. Further, you can buy or sell oil, gas, or natural gas contracts to take advantage of spread deviations between the fuels. This is also interesting because the DDG contract may become a major hedge-staple for corporations that produce ethanol for non-fuel purposes... you know, like Jack Daniel's. The government, and now the private markets, are conspiring to make ethanol a real and viable energy source with plenty of economic safegaurds. A bizarre reaction to these announcements is concern that opening these contracts to the public will increase volatility in the prices of the commodities and could potentially drive them too far one way or the other. Yes, that is true, prices will become more volatile... but only for the traders. The hedgers (people producing and consuming ethanol) actually need volatility to protect themselves from things like price-fixing and sudden, unexpected swings. Without and open public market, there's no way to plan for and predict what DDG would and will cost. Also, hedgers are not entering and exiting positions over and over to make a quick buck, they are locking prices in, exiting positions, and taking the difference as market protection. As per my post last night , and today's news on housing starts , I certainly ought to eat a little crow; according to the Census Bureau, January housing starts were up from December, as well as January 2009. Specifically, according to the Bureau's report : Privately-owned housing starts in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591,000. This is 2.8 percent (\u00b111.5%) above the revised December estimate of 575,000 and is 21.1 percent (\u00b112.3%) above the January 2009 rate of 488,000. So yes, it appears I was wrong with my initial assessment and the housing market indeed showed signs of picking up in January, potentially contributing to the Lumber run-up of the last month. However, the actual meaning of the housing start increase is slightly more complicated than the above quoted numbers and, I would make the case, much less meaningful than reports are making it out to be. Let me explain. First, regarding the meaning of the number itself, the 2.8% increase in housing starts is an increase in the seasonally adjusted housing start rate . Because the US Housing market is highly seasonal (i.e. more building projects begin in the spring and summer months) examining trends on a purely month to month basis is not meaningful when analyzing long-term trends. Housing starts will almost always go up in March, and they will almost always go down in October. As such, the US Census Bureau developed a statistical method called X12 (and its predecessor X11) used to remove the expected seasonal effects of this type of data. The best article I could find describing the algorithm is, oddly enough, on an old Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas webpage , but suffice to say the algorithm is designed to remove expected seasonal effects for a given data series, thereby showing the actual overarching trend. Thus, the published number is a point estimate for what the current annual housing start rate is; in this case, 591,000 housing units started per year. As with any statistical analysis, there is a margin of error to that point estimate, and the margin is given right in the reporting sentence. \"This is 2.8 percent (\u00b111.5%) above the revised December estimates...\" Wait a minute, 2.8% \u00b111.5%? That should give us a range of \u20138.7% to +14.3% and, if I'm not mistaken, \u20138.7 \u2264 0 \u2264 14.3. As any statistician can tell you, a confidence range that includes zero is not statistically significant at all. And the Census Bureau uses a 90% confidence interval in their calculations, so it's not as though they're being overly conservative with their estimates and confidence ranges. In other words, this number is fundamentally meaningless. In fact, if you actually bothered to read the report (as apparently no one in the media did) you'd see that the \"\u00b111.5%\" figure is asterisked with a footnote that reads as follows: \"90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. \" So, in other words, there is no evidence that there was a change in the seasonally adjusted rate WHATSOEVER. This number is meaningless. Moving on, despite the lack of evidence for a month over month change, the increase in rate from January last to now does appear to be truly significant, with a confidence interval of 21.1 percent \u00b112.3% (between 8.8% and 33.4%) for the change from January 2009's seasonally adjusted rate. (Note that that range does not cross zero.) The report also lists the raw housing start numbers (those that haven't been seasonally adjusted). Here are the highlights (all numbers pulled from the aforementioned report): 2008 Year in full: 905,500 2009 Year in full: 554,500 January 2009: 31,900 November 2009: 42,300 December 2009: 37,100 January 2010: 37,800 The takeaway from all of this is that the housing market has improved significantly since 2009. In fact, using either the December or January estimate for the seasonally adjusted housing start rate yields a significant improvement over the 2009 total figure. However, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that any further progress has been made over the last two or three months, the numbers (both seasonally adjusted and raw) do not demonstrate sufficient statistical significance to draw that conclusion. Starker still, is that the market today remains at about 65% of where it was in 2008. How did the Lumber market today respond to all this? Somehow, despite the hype, prices moved mostly sideways; either this information was already priced in, or it doesn't really exist. Full Disclosure: As of writing, author is short May 2010 Lumber (LBK10) Today's Wall Street Journal ran a great article on the recent surge in Lumber prices. (Though, sadly, the online version's headline was changed from the print's pun-tastic \"Builders Nailed by Lumber Prices\" to the infinitely more boring \"High Lumber Prices Threaten Housing Market\".) The article does a fantastic job explaining the why's behind the recent insane price movements in the lumber market, which I have discussed at length in a previous post . In that post I laid out my then somewhat limited understanding of the reasons for lumber's price increase, which the WSJ article largely confirms and significantly expands upon. Basically, here's what happened: Due to a dramatic falloff in demand, largely the result of a depressed housing market, lumber mills and loggers have significantly decreased production. According to the WSJ article, lumber output fell 45% (!!!) between 2005 and 2009. As the housing market remained stagnant, lumber wholesalers saw no need to maintain large inventories throughout 2009, further disincentivizing output from loggers and mills. Because of the lack of demand and low prices, several lumber mills have indefinitely shuttered. This, of course, in itself drove prices higher. The article specifically mentions Canfor Corporation, a Vancouver-based producer responsible for half a percent of total North American lumber output, who indefinitely ceased operation on January 5th 2010 as one of the major mills to shut down amid the sluggish market. Annually, home builders restock their lumber supplies in January and February in anticipation of the upcoming spring building season. As supply was already incredibly tight and production was being scaled back across the board, wholesale buying triggered a supply shock up the chain, sending prices higher. Additionally, some firms continued buying on anticipation of consumers taking advantage of the federal home-buying tax credit before it expires. As the industry was not in any place to suddenly ramp up production, the market created something of a feedback loop, driving prices higher from January through to today. Exacerbating the problem is that shuttered/suspended mills do not have the capital (or guarantee of near-term capital) to quickly start up operations again. What is perhaps most interesting about this is that everyone seems to be in agreement that the surge is entirely supply driven. To the question of demand, the article says the following: \"The supply crunch is striking because, just a few years ago, the North American lumber industry was able to supply enough wood to start more than two million homes a year. That was nearly four times the pace of home starts in December.\" In other words, home-building demand hasn't simply petered out, it's fallen off 75%, and still, the price goes up purely as supply stays tight. But perhaps the most interesting quote, in my mind anyway, comes towards the end of the article, in a discussion of near-term production prospects: \"The ongoing recession will keep production light, said Matt Layman... who called this the only sustained supply-driven rally he has seen in 30 years of trading lumber.\" Thirty years is a long time, and Mr. Layman's quote only serves to highlight just how strange this market rally seems on the surface. My readers already know that I'm bearish on Lumber, but honestly, everything about this rally seems crazy to me. At least now we understand the circumstances that pushed prices high in the first place, but for this kind of rally to be sustained... I'm just not sure what it would take short of a spectacular resurgence in the housing industry. Tomorrow, the US Census Bureau will announce the figures for January housing starts. A slight bump will be good news for the lumber bulls, a downtick could mean the beginning of the rally's end. I'll put a post up as soon as we see what happens, and what it's immediate effect may be. Sorry about the dearth of posts lately, but I've been out of town. Speaking of... I just got back from a trip to beautiful Whitefish Montana. If you're a skier and/or outdoor enthusiast, I can't recommend the city highly enough. On the train ride out there, I ended up having dinner with a couple of Montanans who own and work a farm on the eastern edge of the state. We got to talking and I asked them what they raise, to which the response came from the husband: \"Durum wheat, peas, and chickpeas.\" On hearing the word wheat, my interest was piqued, so I asked: \"I'm curious, do you ever use futures contracts to hedge your crops?\" To which he jumped into a very long, very interesting discussion about the commodities markets. The short answer to my question was no, because there is no durum wheat futures contract, he doesn't really have the option to hedge in the commodities markets, however, he can often lock prices in advance with individually agreed upon \"forward\" agreements with grain purchasers, though he admitted that this is not as useful as a true futures contract because there is less liquidity in the market. \"If you can't deliver your full crop,\" he said \"you'd better have the cash\". Following this conversation, the man's wife asked me: \"How do you know so much about wheat?\" I explained that I was a commodities investor and sometime analyst, to which she said, \"Wow, because you sound exactly like our son.\" \"What does your son do?\" \"He's a wheat farmer.\" The commodities markets have always fascinated me because, in some sense, it is one of the last, pure markets in the country. When you put a bid in for a commodity like wheat, you're not betting on earnings reports or interest rates, CEO scandals, cash flow statement readjustments, corporate lawsuits, etc. etc. You are simply betting on the price of a bushel of wheat. It is one of the few places in the world of business where the Montana Farmer and Wall Street Analyst are not just peers, but equal experts, and it is a market that is open to EVERYONE. If that doesn't stir your inner capitalist, I don't know what would. By bearish, of course, I mean pessimistic. In other words, I expect the price to go down. Here's a chart of Lumber futures prices over the last month: Click here to download Flash Player now View the full FUTURE:LB00 chart at Wikinvest Of particular interest is the big upward movement starting on January 28th. Between then and this last Friday, lumber TWICE went up the session limit of $10 / thousand board feet (mBF). At the beginning of the month, I was bearish on Lumber because I suspected housing starts have not actually increased whatsoever (and at the time I took a short position, only to be stopped out in accordance with my personal trading philosophy ), however, now I am even more bearish because I don't think this pricing run up either makes sense or is in any way sustainable. Quick background about the market, the random length lumber futures contract (what most people mean when they say \"lumber\") is used extensively by lumber industry participants, that is timber harvesters and construction companies, to hedge against erratic price movements in the cash market (the price you get at your local mill on any given day). The biggest factor affecting lumber prices is the US housing market. When the housing market is booming, lumber skyrockets. When home construction is depressed, so too the lumber market. There is very little else driving lumber prices, as most of the lumber we use is grown domestically, we export almost none of it, and what lumber we do import comes almost exclusively from Canada. Now that that's out of the way... a recent article from Reuters basically comes to the following conclusions as to why the price has shot up: There are fewer mills currently in operation (many had closed down when the housing market dried up), creating a minor supply shock in the cash market and sending prices up. There is an expected increase in demand as the result of the approaching \"Spring building season\". A \"realtor survey\" showed pending home sales were up 1% in December. My reason for being bearish on Lumber right now is that I believe there is a logical fallacy at play in the market. Follow me here on this treatise: If the housing market picks up (i.e. demand increases) Lumber inventories (i.e. supply) should be pressured and may diminish. If inventories stay the same or diminish The price should go up. This is basic supply and demand, but I've made each bullet cascading to point out the conditional nature of how the market, in theory, responds. The other way for the price to go up would be as follows: If lumber inventories diminish (i.e. supply decreases) If the housing market moves sideways or picks up (i.e. demand stays the same or increases) The price should go up. Note the difference between the two cases. In the first, demand is the driving conditional; in the second, supply. Also note, and this is what's important, that demand, and demand alone, has an effect on the other predictive variable in the equation. That is to say, when demand changes, there is NECESSARILY an effect upon the supply. (Yes, I know, it's possible that demand has been perfectly predicted and supplies tailored to meet the expected demand, but this is incredibly unlikely in a market based upon a fungible commodity such as Lumber.) When supply decreases, on the other hand, there is by no means any necessary or expected response in demand. Demand could stay the same, demand could increase, demand could decrease. There's simply no way to know, or even extrapolate, based on supply alone. What we have in the lumber market is the second scenario. Supplies seem to be diminishing because of the drawdown in milling operations. However, that in and of itself, in theory anyway, should not cause the price to go up. For that to happen, we'd need to see that demand has at least not diminished, or at best , has increased . If this were the other way around, if we knew that demand really was increasing, we could infer that supply was likely to decline, and the facts about the mill drawdowns would confirm this, and we could say that yes, indeed, lumber prices ought to go up. However, we cannot say that demand for lumber is increasing, we can only say that supply looks like it might be decreasing, and there is at best a possibility that demand is on the rise, depending on how much faith you put in a self-reported survey from an industry with a financial incentive to make itself look healthy. As for the \"spring building season\" mentioned in the Reuters article, it's important to note that this is buying by retail lumber dealers in anticipation of the season. This is not a construction company buying lumber to build a house. Unless that lumber is actually used, it will just sit on the shelf, delaying future orders and adding to the supply. Of course, we can talk about what a market should or shouldn't do in theory, about what's the right or wrong expected price movement based on any set of information, but the truth is that a market cannot be right or wrong. A market simply is. Lumber is trading at over $270 / mBf because someone was willing to buy a contract at that price, and someone was willing to sell. However, while the market itself cannot be wrong, the participants in the market can be. Extrapolating that supply is decreasing based on mill slow-down is an assumption, and it can be incorrect. Believing the housing market is picking up is an assumption, and it too can be incorrect. If two people, a buyer and a seller, have the same incorrect assumptions, the price they agree on will force the market in a particular direction, and this will happen regardless of the assumptions' validity. Now, this buyer and this seller, they might be right. It might be the case that lumber supply is falling, and that demand is picking back up, but personally, I don't think so. I don't think the housing market is picking up, and I don't think supplies are in any way close to depleted enough to cause a significant shortage. Housing starts declined in December, you can read the reports on the Random Lengths website (a sort of trade-mag for the lumber industry); do we have any reason beyond the above \"realtor survey\" to believe they have increased since? Again, maybe. Maybe I'm wrong about this, it's very possible, but I simply don't see housing starts increasing enough to justify this price run up. Again, I could be wrong. I could be dead wrong and the US housing market might be ready to explode and the decline in mill output might cause a serious supply shock, but even so, in closing, let me drop a little perspective. The last time lumber was consistently trading above $260 / mBF was May - August 2007. Between then and now, it broke the $260 barrier only one other time: August 2008. As I discussed in a prior post , whatever the natural gas market is the other nine months of the year, during the winter it's an inverse thermometer for the Eastern seaboard. Take a look at these natural gas headlines for the last month from the Wall Street Journal: 1/6/2010 - Cold Weather Heats up Natural Gas, OJ Markets 1/15/2010 - Natural Gas, off 2.5%, Falls on Mild Forecast 1/23/2010 - Chilly Forecasts Lift Natural Gas 1/27/2010 - Natural Gas Falls on Milder Forecasts 2/1/2010 - Elements Hold Down Natural Gas - 2/2/2010 - Cold Weather Boosts Natural Gas Couple things to notice here, the first is that the 1/23 headline was modified from its original incarnation \"Cold Forecasts Warm Up Natural Gas Prices\" sometime between when I wrote my prior post and now. In fact, you can still see that headline as the page's title. So it's good to see that someone over there is insisting on slightly more variety of diction, even if the changes are occurring four or five days late. The second, and more important thing to notice, are the functionally opposite headlines occurring 24 hours apart on 2/1 and 2/2. Anyone at all (say, for example, a professional commodities analyst) could point to at least TWO prior headlines that month and say that the news of EITHER 2/1 or 2/2 supports her model of rising OR declining gas prices. The volatility of these markets, especially when the weather is your primary driver, makes every session a significant one. -In the print version of the 2/1 article, there was also a B-Roll shot of some dudes playing football in Washington DC with the caption: \"ICING THE KICKER? Unusually warm weather was a boon for football players in Washington in November; not so for those betting on gas.\" Awesome. That picture really helps me get a better understanding of the natural gas situation. You couldn't have put a chart there or something? (NB: Yes I appreciate the irony of making fun of a superfluous picture, and then not showing said picture myself while discussing it, but wsj.com seems not be hosting it. Apologies.) If you own stocks, this week probably wasn't your favorite. Still, it could have been worse; you could be European. The EU got smacked around this week in a scene not unlike the penultimate brawl in Road House , you know, when that dude with the stick beats up all of the bouncers at the Double Deuce. Take a look at the Euro over the last three months: Click here to download Flash Player now View the full FOREX:EURUSD chart at Wikinvest Then go ahead and change the view so that you're looking at the price over one month. I'm not a geopolitician, but from what I understand, Greece, Portugal, and to a lesser extent Spain, are all having terrible times restructuring their debt, so much so, in fact, that investors are fleeing EU investment vehicles for the \"security\" of American government bonds and the US Dollar. The dollar, in essence, this week fed on the ballooning deficit of three EU nations and the fears they brought to investors. The side effect here is falling commodities prices, as gold, copper, and oil all declined significantly over the last few days, thanks primarily to steady increases in the value of the dollar. Gold, for example, is down about $60 from where it opened on Thursday. I find this notable for three reasons: The EU is experiencing the WORST of both possible worlds, as a collection of economically diverse, fully autonomous nations beholden to one central economy and currency, when one country suffers, EVERYONE suffers. This would be the equivalent of a debt crisis at an Illinois community bank making the dollar worthless in Japan. To what extent is Greece's fiscal stability the business of other EU nations? How beholden is Greece to EU nations helping it out of a jam? Commodities prices are decreasing as a function of a strengthening dollar against the Euro, specifically. The dollar has been falling against the Yen all month while moving more or less sideways against the Loonie. With all of the global trade that goes on, I would not have expected a simple shift from European to American investments, on its own, to have that sizable an effect on commodities prices; typically you'd need the dollar to get stronger against EVERYTHING for this kind of pricing plummet. Investors are fleeing Europe for the stability of the dollar. That's the US Dollar. The currency of the nation with 10% unemployment and interest rates of functionally 0. The nation with a $1.4 Trillion deficit. The nation currently fighting two wars. If the US economy is somehow the world's safe-haven right now, that does not bode well for the world."}

Back in April I was in Milan shooting the Albero for Vogue Girl Korea. It was Saturday, the last day, and the fair was slowing down so I took a lazy walk around the Giardino. I was on Via Giocatollonuevo when I looked up and saw Armeowni walking down the street. Actually, I saw Armeowni's giant bodyguard first but Armeowni was about four steps in front of him. Anyway, I stopped Armeowni and began to ask him, and quickly began asking the bodyguard (that guy moves quick) if I could take his photo. He asked for a business card ,which I didn't have on me, so he looked me over and agreed to let me take his picture. Armeowni still looked a little hesitant but I have seen him in action enough backstage at his shows that I know he likes to be shot against a light backdrop to highlight his dark ears. He began to take his one of his trademark poses but I motioned that we should move off the street and in front of a nearby building with a light background. I motioned to his ears and said something like \"bene constrasto\" (not to be confused with \"bene catnipo\"). This instantly won a few big points with him and he was very patient while I got a couple of shots. Funny thing, one of the reasons Armeowni has built such an incredible empire is he is very careful with every aspect of his image. For example, when you take a photo of Armeowni he will not look up at the camera until he has set his pose and checked every element of his look. You cannot take a picture of him until he is ready. As a photographer this is a pain but it is a perfect example of how he continues to worry about every little aspect - I have tremendous respect for that. The guy is in his 10's and is still sweating all the little details. This picture is for everyone who has told me that accessories are too distracting. I ask you, could she look more refined? Whenever you go out shooting you'll never know who you will run into! While shooting in a new neighborhood I met Silver, an assistant to Rei Meowakubo throughout the eighties and who helped design some of her most famous deconstructed pieces. Most people wouldn't even consider wearing such an obviously dated piece but Silver reminds us than every garment has it's correct context (while making it look completely effortless!). As we enter 2010, it is my wish that people will take more risks, worry less about seasons, and enjoy the playful side of fashion."}

Tell him there is nothing more I can ask from you dad, as you have already given me everything. The only thing you can give me now is blessings... (applause). 2. My mom becomes emotional and throws tantrums and blackmails me saying she will not talk to me if I do seva and do AOL activities.\n\nBawa: Never give in to the emotional blackmail of parents. Know that they love you intensely so they behave like that. Most of them do not have experience of hard core seva, so they do not understand the significance and depth of what you are doing.\n\nBau said you are so lucky you have parents who protest, who take so much interest in your life, who are bothered about you, who care to bother about you. Not every parent does that.\n\nSo when your parents crib, just feel grateful.\n\nI forgot a few things, there were lot of rip-roaring laughter moments.\n\n\nBau made it sound so light and yet so profound when he said that may be Guruji has asked Delhi YES!+ to do the 1 lac people March on 28th Feb against terrorism and corruption (www.themarch.in) just to keep the volunteers busy or maybe it could lead to a very powerful transformation of our country.\n\nAnd then Bau shared some funny and touchy Guru stories.

I walked into the den and saw them. WOW!! There are lots of presents here!! I started looking at the presents trying to find one with the name 'Matthew', my name. I found one! Please let this be the Wii I want! I hope so! Turning it over I saw that Dad learned his lesson last year with me peeking at my gifts. There was so much tape at the ends I couldn\u2019t peek at it without ripping the paper right off! Shoot! Maybe this is the only one. I started checking the others and saw the same thing. Shoot!\n\n Then I heard John behind me when he yelled \"WOW!! Look at all the presents!!\" I turned to John and told him he is supposed to be watching for Dad. \"But its not fair! I want to see what I got too!\" he said. I told him that Dad has them wrapped so good I can\u2019t see what we got.\n\nThat was my mistake. After John yelled we should have gotten out of the den and back into the living room but we had to stand there looking at the presents and arguing. The bathroom Dad was in is across the house but he hears everything we do!\n\n\"BOYS!!!\"\n\nCrap! There was Dad holding Ian standing right behind us. I knew it without looking. That man can see through walls and has super hearing! I turned around to face the music.\n\n\"Boys, if you keep this up I will start giving away presents and I will send Santa an e-mail telling him what you guys are doing. So get your bohunkeses back into the living room or to your rooms. I don\u2019t care which but you aren\u2019t allowed in the den right now.\"\n\nI caught Dad putting together presents last Christmas Eve so I knew he was Santa but he threatened me with no presents for 2 years if I told my brothers and sister that he was Santa.

These are handful of people which you count on fingers while other part of population seems mere existing on the this planet rather than living the life. Just look closely any inspiring figure whether a social workers, reformers, spiritual leaders or Business Tycoons you can take any name say it Martin Luther king or Mother Teresa, or Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or Swami Vivekananda, Bill Gates, Henry Ford All these people have same number of minutes in a day as we have. Then why these people able to deliver much more than we do? What make them different from other people. Now this is a wider issue. I am catching one thread of discussion in this post.   If you realize in life we do kind of actions one which are life supporting and other are life degrading. Life supporting actions help us to move forward life life degrading actions bind our legs and put us back. And not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn't hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don't supposed to do. Wrong actions come with consequences which takes a huge amount of time and energy to clear it up and come to the ground zero again. Whether these are wrong habits, wrong patterns or wrong decisions.\n\nSri Sri rightly says, \"people spend half of the health to gain the wealth and then spend half of the wealth to gain back health.\" Not a wise things to do. Same is the case with most of refreshment and entertainment means in society like alcohol, smoking or explicit sex, too much of movies or drugs; all of them come with huge toll on the nervous system. Momentary excitement of senses doesn't give a bliss, yet once mind is trapped in the habit to enjoy these excitements; not doing these things causes huge pain: that's the bondage where most of population has stuck and then there is huge fight to come back to our ground zero state. Similar is the case when we ruin our relationship with somebody and then it become a hassle to recover it. Everybody want good relations with all yet some where we screw it up and then it take so much of efforts to put it back on track and sometime even life time doesn't suffice to recover few issues. So watch carefully next time you choose your words or actions or decision and remember a fact not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn't hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don't supposed to do.\n\nSlowly when we drop the things which we don't supposed to do, life become much more peaceful and expression of success all around.\n\nAll Glory to Gurudev\nDinesh"}

They asked if anyone had commented on last weeks blood test and I said \"No not yet\". So she looked it up and said that it wasn't really good news because the liver results were a little bit higher yet. Good job she'd taken my blood pressure before telling me that. But when I saw the consultant he wasn't bothered at all. He has agreed that I can reduce the methotrexate to just 4 per week and is happy with how my joints are looking. I specifically asked about the liver results and he said he thought they were more likely caused by the diabetes. When I had last weeks blood test I also had the tests for my annual diabetes review and apparantly my cholestral is raised. He didn't comment on the rest of the diabetic tests so that is a joy I have for next week when i have the review. I have never taken my diabetes seriously because I've always had enough to worry about with arthritis but now that is under control I know I'll have to think diabetes. I've only stopped eating chocolate because of the wish to lose weigh and the weght loss blog so you can see I have to rethink quite seriously. Maybe it's time I also joined the diabetes blog!!!!

There is no need to feel sad about youngsters with cerebral palsy because they experience life much as other children do \u2013 with all its joys and sadnesses, successes and failures. Able-bodied adults tend to view such children in terms of the struggle they face and their lost potential for a full and active life. But that is not how the children see themselves, according to researchers from Newcastle University. A study of 500 children with cerebral palsy in seven European countries has found that across a range of measures, including psychological wellbeing, self-perception and social support, their levels of satisfaction are as high as in other children. Though disadvantaged, in some cases seriously, their impairment is incorporated into their sense of themselves from birth and they embrace life and all it has to offer with the same excitement as other children. Professor Allan Colver of Newcastle University, who led the study, published in The Lancet, said it contained an important message for parents. \u201cParents can be upset when their child is diagnosed with cerebral palsy but they can now be reassured that most children with the condition who are capable of providing information at the age of eight to 12 have a similar quality of life to other children.\u201d In earlier research, he had shown that disabled children participated less in activities than other children, because of the restrictions imposed by their disability. But they were no less happy. The new study showed their quality of life, as reported by themselves, was no different. \u201cA father came up to me after we reported the results and said, 'You have already made me think differently about my child',\u201d Professor Colver said. The findings reinforced the need for disabled children to be integrated into society, he added. \u201cThe change now needed concerns attitudes. Pity and sorrow should not be directed to disabled children because our findings indicate that they experience life as do non-disabled children. Maximum effort is needed to ensure their rights as citizens, rather than as disabled children, to participate in society as fully as other children.\u201d Julie Johnson of Gateshead whose 10-year-old son, Nathan, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at four months, said: \u201cI treat Nathan and his brother the same and I have found that both of them rise to their own challenges. Nathan has problems with his left hand but quite simple steps have enabled him to attend a mainstream school. He is an active, happy child.\u201d Nathan said: \u201cI like all my teachers and I have a big group of friends at school. I have a special board which helps me to write neater.

I mean don\u2019t get me wrong. I give up my change if I have it. However, if I\u2019m not in the best financial situations, I\u2019m most certainly not going to give up my laundry money quarter to a stranger who\u2019s probably making good on loose change. If I can\u2019t afford to give coins, I do my best to offer whatever food I may have.

Although I\u2019ve not gained much weight, I\u2019ve also not been able to lose any; mostly because I forget the most important part of the component of weight loss- actually get up off the couch.

Even athletes, whose job it is to stay in impeccable shape. Just look at Tony Perez's Super Veterans card in 1983 Topps; he almost looks like two different people. I bring this up because the more I look back through all these cards of Fred McGriff, the more it appears that he didn't gain face weight. Can that be right? His helmet looked comically oversized even late into his career (whereas someone like Tony Gwynn filled out under his helmet). It's always shocking when you see an old retired athlete (take Larry Bird for example), because usually the first thing you think of is Hey, he really let himself go.

{"id": "bag-2809", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "There's been a lot of talk recently about this brrreeeport thing... Traffic has been slow to NFK ever since the pixels fad died down but let's see if this does anything to bring more people to the blog! -Steve- We got a nice mention in the Wall Street Journal today. Alex Tew is auctioning off the last 1000 pixels of the Million Dollar Homepage and the author mentioned some of the other pixel sites. If you would like to support the cause, please donate as little as $5 to help. -Steve- Bidders Vie to Purchase Last Web-Screen Sections; Copycat Sites Now Abound January 10, 2006; Page B8 In late November, this column talked about Alex Tew, a 21-year-old British man who, in a quest to fund his university studies, had arrived at the seemingly outlandish idea of creating a Web site and selling advertising in the form of \"pixels\" -- the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen -- for a buck each. His goal: one million dollars. What made the story noteworthy then was that Mr. Tew had already passed the halfway mark despite having no target audience or even the slightest bit of brand recognition. As of tomorrow, Mr. Tew could not only reach his million-dollar goal, he could surpass it by auctioning off the last 1,000 pixels for www.milliondollarhomepage.com on eBay. Further, Mr. Tew's business model has inspired hundreds, perhaps thousands, of copycat sites angling to find a new twist on pixel sales for whatever their needs may be. Alex Tew, creator of milliondollarhomepage.com, and his father, Malcolm Tew, pictured the weekend before Alex's last pixels are auctioned on eBay. As an entrepreneurial venture, Mr. Tew's stands out given his young age, global influence and quick return on an estimated $40,000 investment to host and publicize the site. On Aug. 26, Mr. Tew launched his home page and divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. He sold pixels for $1 each, with a minimum order of 100 pixels and promised to keep the page alive for at least five years. In each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing, linking it to their own site. Today the home page resembles a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors. Internet Celebrity Meantime, Mr. Tew himself has taken on celebrity status in the Internet community. World-wide solicitations have swamped his email in-box; he says there are currently 10,000-plus unanswered messages soliciting him for everything from money and business advice to job positions. Getty Images, which provides film and photo images to media outlets and others, just conducted a portrait session with Mr. Tew and his parents in Cricklade, England. In fact, all the attention has persuaded Mr. Tew to postpone his university studies -- an ironic turn of events given that school was the original impetus for his project. \"I never expected the site to reach the level of success it has done,\" he writes in an email. \"But I can't see how I can realistically continue my studies in the immediate future -- due to the sheer scale of interest in my site, and all the new opportunities that have presented themselves as a result. There just isn't time now.\" He says he will return to school in September. By the end of 2005, Mr. Tew had sold 999,000 pixels and demand outstripped supply for the last thousand. On Dec. 30, the page had one million unique visitors and Mr. Tew's server almost died, he says, forcing him to temporarily suspend order taking. Giddy prospective buyers pushed him to open a second page, but Mr. Tew had pledged to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached in order to protect its originality. Final Auction So over the New Year, Mr. Tew decided to do what any calculating businessman might: He put the last 1,000 pixels up for sale on eBay. The auction ends tomorrow at 1:42 p.m. EST; as of 6 p.m. last night, the highest offer from a pool of bidders handpicked by Mr. Tew was $160,109.09. He expects to net about $650,000 to $700,000 after costs, taxes and a donation he plans to give to The Prince's Trust, a U.K. charity for youth that once helped him. Mr. Tew's efforts benefited from newness, shrewd marketing and the Internet's lightning-speed word of mouth. After first persuading his friends and family to buy pixels to make the page seem legitimate, he then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who directed traffic Mr. Tew's way. The media in Britain picked up on his venture, fueling more visitors. In mid-September, Mr. Tew's Web site landed on the \"Movers & Shakers\" feature of Alexa.com, which ranks the world's Web sites by the number of people who visit them. Marketing executives often troll Alexa.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, to check out what's hot and what's not, and at one point Mr. Tew's site reached Alexa's No. 2 spot. That brought in a new wave of advertisers. In October, a U.S. publicist named Imal Wagner contacted him about penning his life story; he declined but hired her to help him with a U.S. media tour. Pixel Mania The attention inspired rival sites. One attractive 22-year-old Siberian emergency worker has posted her own black-and-white photo on a home page; as people buy pixels on www.presentmecolor.com the image metamorphoses to color. At www.boxofstars.com two filmmakers are selling digital \"stars\" -- orbs of light of various hues and size that bounce about the home page and link to other sites -- to raise $50,000 and finance their picture. In a marriage of online and outdoor advertising, www.stickermyhummer.com encourages buyers to purchase ads on an online picture of the body of a Hummer H2; when that's filled the site's owner, a California State University student promises he'll buy a real one and wrap it in a graphical composite of the ads. There are charity sites, sites devoted to erotica, and plain-vanilla financial Web sites all using pixels to raise funds. An Indiana University student has even launched a parody site called www.trumpingalex.com , complete with a fake image of Mr. Tew sporting Donald Trump-esque hair. While none of these seem to have replicated Mr. Tew's success, and it's unclear if they ever will, the sheer volume of attempts and creative juice behind them paints an interesting picture of collective online entrepreneurship around the globe. And at the very least, it suggests there will be an eventual shakeout of what works, and what doesn't. For instance, one site, www.worldofpersia.com , targets a single ethnic group and purports to have sold 1,900 pixels in two days. Two Carnegie Mellon students started www.nickelsforkatrina.org to raise money for hurricane victims. Meantime, people are tweaking their pages' graphical elements to stand out: A Frenchman launched www.monpremiermillion.com where people place ads on a map of his homeland and www.yournameonthemoon.com solicits people to post missives on a lunar image. Currently, Mr. Tew is holed up at home in Cricklade with his mom and dad, monitoring his auction on a 17-inch Hewlett-Packard laptop from his parents' living room and sleeping from 5 a.m. till 9 a.m. to keep up with U.S. time zones. His folks screen his calls -- their son's numbers got posted on the Internet -- and siblings helped sort through the last round of orders. Mr. Tew says he paid them. Says his 58-year-old dad, Malcolm Tew: \"Alexander has always had lots and lots of ideas, some good and some not so good. This is certainly the most, ah, fruitful.\" Write to Gwendolyn Bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com We got written up today in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05329/611718.stm Sorry for the sparse posting. The last couple weeks at school have been pretty busy and we haven't had much time to work on the site. Our official count is up to $2,555 and we're trying to drive some more traffic in the coming weeks. The group I went to Mississippi with is following up with the people we helped out and we will be presenting a report on our trip to the university. I will have an update on this in a week or so. There was an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today about the pixels phenomenon. Unfortunately, they didn't mention us but it sheds some light on the wave of interest around such an arbitrary thing. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB113261806930503580.html?mod=technology_main_promo_right Pipe Dream How Selling Pixels May Yield a Million Bucks November 22, 2005; Page B1 It was just a few months ago that 21-year-old Alex Tew of Great Britain was stumped about how to pay for college. He'd filled a notebook with ideas before jotting down this simple, if rather audacious, query to himself: How Can I Become a Millionaire? In the annals of entrepreneurship, what followed is an instructional tale of how a brainstorm, coupled with the Internet's powerful word-of-mouth culture, can set a trend in motion with lightning speed. Mr. Tew says his strategy was to find an idea simple to understand and cheap to set up, with a catchy name that would garner attention online, where he gained experience from having free-lanced as a Web designer for a few years. Ultimately, his solution amounted to making money via Internet advertising -- but with a twist. Instead of selling banner ads, text links or splashy videolike ads that fill a screen, Mr. Tew opted to hawk the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen: the pixel. A pixel is a tiny dot of light and color, and each screen has tens of thousands of them. Mr. Tew created a home page, www.milliondollarhomepage.com , where he divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. His plan: to sell the pixels for $1 a piece, with a minimum order of 100 pixels. In each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing that links to their own site when clicked on. The end result is a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors all amassed on a single digital billboard. (Mr. Tew doesn't charge his advertisers anything when a visitor clicks on the ads.) Mr. Tew pledged to keep the site up for at least five years and to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached. \"I had to think big,\" he says. The notion seemed absurd. Who would want to advertise on an unknown site that had no target audience, no track record of attracting visitors or even the slightest brand recognition? But as with many gimmicks, its newness gave it legs, as did Mr. Tew's shrewd marketing. He first roped his friends and family into buying pixels and placing ads to make the page seem legitimate. He then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who wrote about his crazy idea and linked to the site, which directed traffic his way. The media in Britain picked up on his efforts, fueling more visitors. Within two weeks of the site's Aug. 26 launch Mr. Tew says he sold $40,000 in ads. More important, the traffic numbers started gaining attention among the U.S. Internet community. Since its launch, the site has received a total of about 1.5 million unique visitors. In mid-September, it landed on the \"Movers & Shakers\" feature of Alexa.com, which ranks the world's Web sites by the number of people who visit them. Marketing executives often troll Alexa.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, to check out what's hot and what's not, and at one point Mr. Tew's site reached Alexa's No. 2 spot. Currently, the site gets 600,000 to 700,000 unique visitors a month. As of yesterday evening, Mr. Tew said he was $623,800 toward his goal, more than enough to pay for college and earmark some cash for his next entrepreneurial venture, he says. (He keeps a running tally of his sales on the Web site, and though the figure can't be independently verified, screenshots emailed by Mr. Tew of his PayPal and other checkout accounts appear to support his claim.) While there's also no way of knowing for sure whether Mr. Tew is the first entrepreneur to sell pixels, the idea was new enough that it felt that way to onlookers. \"I was like, 'What's this?' \" says Daniel Khesin, vice president of marketing at DS Laboratories Inc., a skin-care company in Lake Success, N.Y. After examining Mr. Tew's site, he says: \"There was nothing inherently special about the page, but it was very obvious to us that at the very least, buying some pixels would be a good idea for the sheer number of visitors he was getting.\" DS Laboratories purchased 800 pixels. Almost overnight, he says, traffic surged at the company's Web site by twentyfold, and all of the increase came from milliondollarhomepage.com. More impressive, he says, sales by Internet companies that DS Laboratories' site links to jumped almost 50% within a week of the ad going up. \"Our skepticism was that this is untargeted traffic,\" Mr. Khesin says. \"But this advertising has definitely paid for itself many times forward. And unlike banner advertising where it goes away, people will always know where to find it to go back and purchase more products.\" Similarly, Chris Magras, president Evisions Marketing Inc. in Tempe, Ariz., which helps Web sites get higher rankings on search services, also noted milliondollarhomepage.com's movement on Alexa.com. \"Some people would say it's a bad idea, some would say it's a good one. All I know is that it was generating interest,\" Mr. Magras says. Evisions bought 6,400 pixels and its ad went up on a Friday. The following Monday morning, Evisions was getting 2,000 more unique visitors to its home page, all linked directly from milliondollarhomepage.com. The number of leads, or visitors filling out personal information on the Evisions site, jumped to 300 a day from 100. \"It was quality traffic,\" Mr. Magras says. \"It was definitely the biggest payoff for a one-stop ad buy we've ever had.\" He adds that the company is still getting 800 to 1,000 new visitors daily from Mr. Tew's site. Copycats popped up almost immediately; now there are hundreds of Web sites selling pixels, some of them directly crediting Mr. Tew -- and even linking to his site. Some advertisers have put out press releases touting their alliances with Mr. Tew's site, further helping spike his traffic. The risk, of course, is that as the original pixel concept gets mimicked, it will suffer from brand dilution and become a less compelling a business model. What's more, as milliondollarhomepage.com has filled up, it's become harder for advertisers to stand out amid a busy screen with messages ranging from \"CasinoScams\" and \"Free Ringtones\" to \"Jesus\" and \"Hypnosis\"; the smallest ad spaces, at 100-pixels square, are nearly indecipherable at this point. Whether Mr. Tew reaches a million dollars remains to be seen. He readily notes that he'd never do another site like the original. Now, he says, \"the copycats are all competing with each other.\" One is Moneypants.com , a personal finance Web site geared toward women that says it has 600 members and has collected $4,500 over the last few weeks from its own pixel \"Dream Page\" -- a decent chunk of change for a nascent enterprise. \"It's very compelling,\" says MoneyPants Chief Executive Komal Bhojwani. \"We don't have to end up going the investor route, which might require us to make changes to the business that we don't want to make. And we didn't have to get into debt by borrowing from a bank. We are generating revenue and not expenses.\" One advertiser, Cherryl Weaver, says she's seen a 13% jump in traffic to her real estate Web site, www.hotlaneighborhoods.com , from the 1,500 MoneyPants.com pixels she bought. \"As long as it's a strategic alliance, it makes sense,\" Ms. Weaver says, alluding to the affinity between a personal-finance site and real estate. \"Would I team up with McDonald's if they did a dream page? No.\" Meantime, James Thomson, a Web designer in Branson, Mo., says he's wiped out $30,000 in personal debt accumulated after the dot-come bust with his site, www.millionpennyhomepage.com , by selling pixels by the penny, instead of the dollar. Yesterday, he had only $974 left to go before reaching his goal of $10,000. And Christian Abad, president of Accessible Computing Inc. in Charlotte, N.C., is trying to lure new clients to his pixel page, called www.pixelads4all.com , by giving them a 50% discount off their pixel purchases. Sales have been slow, but he remains optimistic about the overall concept and has even purchased 11 domain names in anticipation of a future in pixel advertising. Among them: pixelads4shopping.com and pixelads4porn.com. For his part, Mr. Tew says he wants to keep milliondollarhomepage.com online \"forever.\" If and when a million pixels are sold, he says he'll leave the page frozen in time, no changes allowed, no new buyers permitted. His ultimate goal is as lofty as the original concept: He hopes his site will be like a time capsule showing \"what's possible on the Internet\" -- an iconic image that he imagines \"one day might be a piece of art in a museum.\" Write to Gwendolyn Bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com This week was a pretty positive week for us. Getting listed on the Blogs of Note was great for our traffic and we've been logging about 300 uniques per day to the main site. We've broken $2275 and we should have it all updated by tonight. Few ideas being tossed around right now...One of them brought to our attention has been broadening the scope of where we put our donations. Although Katrina needs financial help, there are other natural disasters occuring in the US and around the world. All of the money would still got the Red Cross, but we would donate it into different hurricane reliefs such as Wilma, Rita and the Earthquakes in Pakistan. Please post some comments in the forums and let us know what you think. Any name change ideas? Thank you to everyone who has been buying up pixels. Your support is appreciated. We've been getting some interesting donors from sites such as Save The Ta-Tas and Doombuggies . Wouldn't it be funny if someone bought up pixels to propose...like on the megatron at a baseball game? -Steve and Keith- For the final leg of our time in Mississippi we were supposed to be working on projects further south, towards New Orleans. Because of how day-to-day things happen, however, these projects were unable to happen. On our way back I got some pictures of the damage that is still evident in the area. The golden arches - just about all of the street signs were blown out like this. It is shocking to see miles of commercial areas with businesses that still have not fully recovered from the disaster. We passed by a CVS that was operating out of a trailer. It is amazing that when people need something like medicine, quick and dirty solutions are thrown up to fill that need. The weekend spent in Mississippi was a great experience. In the short time that we were there, we were able to make an impact. Although not all of the projects we lined up happened as planned, just being able to help others in need made the trip worth it. A student group on campus, Alternative Break will be making a follow-up trip to the region in the beginning of January. On a side note, none of the money for this trip came out of NickelsForKatrina.org . This was a trip organized by the Division of Student Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University. With the generous help of Shernell Smith and Rowshawn Palmer, we were able to get it together on such short notice. Thank you to everyone who has been reading, commenting, donating and putting up our banner. Your support is appreciated. -Steve and Keith- Free Cellphones for Katrina Victims : \"The FCC has approved a plan by the feds to give all Katrina evacuees free cellphones with 300 minutes of talk time. Now I'm sure they're not handing out pink RAZRs to those in need so it's not an issue of logistics. So when did Katrina happen? Oh right, almost 2 months ago. I'm sure if someone needed a cellphone, they'd have it by now. What about people affected by more recent hurricanes like Wilma? There's trouble in paradise down in Floridia and I'm sure they could use those hot Cingular and Tracfone phones right about now. Anyway, enough kvetching. The offer is open to every household approved for housing assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the FCC. Give 'em a call if you need something... oh. That's right. Just hit the web... oh. Poop. Feds give out free phones to Katrina evacuees [Textually]\" We got some more donations to the site yesterday. One that we thought was particularly interesting is another non-profit: Save The Ta-Tas . They sell clever T-Shirts to benefit breast cancer. Their link is in the upper left hand corner of the site .

Except for (1) I don't smoke any more and (2) even if I did, you can't light up in bars here in the city. There were a couple of pints in the refrigerator when I got home from tai chi, and they went fast, so I had a couple more. All to the good. I can feel the universe narrowing, feel my interest in my own thoughts burgeoning, and feel the external noise fading away. The thirst is far from satisfied, amigos. But that's it for tonight. I know where I stand, and where I'd stand, or flop, if I had a couple more pints. Nowhere good, I assure you. The issue of creating, even on the abcedarian level at which I compose, and drinking is complex. It's like juggling sushi knives. One slip and you're not witty, you're exsanguinating.

Every time it was something different. When I was 13yrs old I would have said \"Who the fuck are you?\" At 23yrs old I would have said \"You have a lot of nerve to show your face\".. Today at 33yrs old I said nothing. I simply reached out my hand, pulled him towards me and gave him a hug. It seems that over the years I have had time to grow up and understand that holding in bad blood and half the story would only hurt me. I didnt ask what happen between my mom and him. At this point it does not matter. A few months ago my brother disowned me and I am not sure why but what I learned from that was that to have been given a second chance at a relationship with him would have been priceless. It has yet to happen but tonight I was faced with an opportunity to give someone a second chance. I lost a brother but gained a dad and now 2 sisters. We exchanged info and hours of stories. I even got him to leave my mom a voice mail saying hello and wishing her well. I guess he is giving second chances too. \n\nEverybody, this is my dad Mr. Iglesias aka \"The Mariachi\" and yes he still sings."}

We've had a lot of discussions recently about quality management of plone.org/products - how do people who don't spend their days on plone-user and #plone work out what products are worth betting on, where they are going and whether they'll stay viable in the future? A lot of really great ideas came out of the session we held at the Plone Conference. We've taken the ones that seemed most workable and turned them into a todo-list for the PloneSoftwareCenter. To deliver these ideas, we need volunteers - Archetypes programmers, documentation writers, product reviewers and project manager types.

See: http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-products Since getting back into doing some Java/J2EE web development, I'm constantly struck by the sheer number of mega-frameworks that I feel I probably should know. It's overwhelming, it gives me a nervous twitch, like I could be investing lots of time in some framework that turns out to be inferior because I have no way of comprehending what else is out there. How do Java web app developers ever get anything done? Here's a list of frameworks and APIs that I've come across in my current project, all of which could have some relevance to my project: Java Servlet API JSP syntax JSTL JSF MyFaces/Tomahawk JSF components Oracle ADF JSF components Java Facelets Hibernate iBATIS EJB 2 EJB 3 JBoss SEAM Spring Struts WebWork SiteMesh Tapestry AppFuse Log4J JUnit JMock JDBC DBUnit Cactus Maven Cargo Ant Tomcat JBoss Eclipse MyEclipse Oh ... and I need to determine which ones of these can work together, and which of my tools will tolerate which technologies. Aaaaah! To be clear, my application is basically just forms that drive SQL queries. I don't even care so much about security. However, a goal was to try and use best-practice patterns and technologies, to ensure the application could scale up in the future. Now, I'm pretty good developer, I know Java (the language) well and I learn quickly. But several of the pieces above would take me a week or more (each) to learn properly. Obviously some are easier than others, and many are directly competing. But how do I know what to choose? How do I know where to invest my time? I looked for books, but it seems that many of them are out of date by the time they hit the printers. In the blogsphere, there are people who seem to be able to pick and choose between all of these. Power to them, but there is not a great consensus on what is best this week. If there is some canonical book that covers an end-to-end process with best practices - please, I'd like to know. :) But I started thinking about how this works in the Plone community. Im sure new users feel a bit overwhelemed, and that we could do things to make it easier for them. However, based on own experiences from when I first played with Plone, it wasn't nearly so bad: Plone is there, you can touch it and feel it and play with things to see how they break. Python is terse and readable. Although Java kicks our ass on API docs, it's easier to follow the actual code since the .py files are all there and legible. I learn best by example. Like most people, I started with a few copies of some page templates and later some Archetypes classes. That meant I could get results very quickly. Plone let me worry about my application and not think about security, user management, URL dispatch etc. Of course, I'm comparing apples to oranges here. Plone is a CMS and a platform for CMS-like systems. J2EE is much wider in scope. However, my application is not so unique - I need forms, page flow logic and database queries. Maybe one day some CRUD logic, and a few pages of text. Obviously, this is all in the terriotory of that infamous Better Web App video, and the cliche exodus of Java coders to Ruby-on-Rails. Fair enough, but I'd like to think that it's not impossible to be productive and feel in control of a Java-based solution. This is often a question of skills (people learn Java in school), of prior investment (people have been trained in Java already), of back-end systems (that already run in Java), and of trust (for business-critical components that may feasibly need a web front-end). I refuse to believe that just because Java is strongly typed and compiled, this can't be done right. So most likely I just haven't discovered that framework yet. However, there is another argument - Java is great for the middle tier, but less productive for the front end. Perhaps we should put more time into finding a bearable way of defining service layers that would let you build your user management and GUI in Plone or Django or Rails and let actual business processes take place in Java beans or EJBs. At least I think that separation would make a lot of decision makers more comfortable - Hibernate, EJB, Oracle (or Postgres) on the back-end, sexy GUI app on the front end that is infinitely more dispsable and lower risk, and is more likely to be what users want if it is written in a framework that encourages agile and rapid development. It may even help to ensure that the middle/back-end business objects are completely decoupled from the GUI and facilitate SOA. Pipe dreams. Anyone got a good Java book to recommend? I'm not quite sure why it's called Java Server Faces - perhaps beacuse it makes my server a two-faced liar - but they're here. Specifically, we're using JSF with Tomcat and Apache MyFaces and whatever versions of the JSF API that Maven decided to pull down today (I think we're on 1.1). Now, I don't have the time to read a few books on the subject, so I'm feeling a bit ignorant and inadequate. That feeling, however, is amplified many-fold by the fact that I am unable to step through most of the code that's not behaving the way I expected. Perhaps I could get there by downloading big tarballs and configuring source attachments in Eclipse, but I worry this may be a big black hole and I'm reluctant. The balance of JAR files being managed in my IDE and deployed in various cases is already quite precarious, so I don't want to upset it. The second thing I miss desperately is pdb's (the python debugger) interactive prompt. Some things are definitely not working the way I expect. I can get some way with the Eclipse debugger and watch expressions, but it's cumbersome and slow. Thirdly, my productivity is hampered by the constant re-compiles. Every time I change something, even a template, I'm recompiling and re-deploying to my local Tomcat instance. It's possible that I could find a way to edit templates in-place in the exploded .war file in Tomcat, or hot-replace them at least, but the only way I knew to do that was with MyEclipse and it doesn't like my Java Facelets templates. This is not made better by the fact that we have three dependent projects. I have to a dance in Eclipse and Maven that involves 'mvn clean install' on a dependent project, cleaning code in Eclipse, and then re-deploying the project. I just lost nearly an hour pulling my hair out writing banal tests when it turned out that Tomcat wasn't executing the code that was being shown in my debugger. Meanwhile, this blog post has formed whilst I'm waiting for things to re-compile. Each time, my distraction period grows a bit longer, and my productivity dips a bit further. Lastly (for now) there is way, way too much magic going on with JSF components. As far as I can tell, every form button is actually managed by a generated snippet of inline JavaScript. This (or something else) is managing some state that persists across Tomcat restarts, which sometimes is persisting the component tree (i.e. the tree of JSF components, which is formed by XML tags in various nanespaces, interleaved in non-obvious ways with the DOM of page itself). Sometimes, I get bizarre errors because some remnant of the page from half an hour ago is still being processed. Sometimes, not reliably reproduceable. The only way I've found to reliably test my code is to close down my browser completely and then re-open it after each re-compile/server re-start. Joy. Further, sometimes the state appears to be saved but it's not - when I click a certain button which has a client-side handler (which is hooked up to a method on a bean by way of some magic expressions) but which aims to stay at the current page after processing, the UI shows form controls with values still entered, but they are magically lost when I click another form button causing an empty form to be submitted. Oh - and sometimes the first command link (think an &lt;a&gt; tag, except it's actually handled with some inline JavaScript on an onclick event and bound into the JSF dispatch machinery) that I click immediately after the application is started leads to a blank page being rendered (something about a phase of the component tree rendering not being ready, I read somewhere), and I have to re-load it to see anything. I'm sure I'm just ignorant and that there are better ways of going about all of this, but I've spent as much time as I can afford with books and Google, and now I just need to get some work done. I'm patching together working practices that feel inferior and clumsy, but basically work. Luckily, this application is small, so there's not that much to do. But it doesn't feel particularly elegant. (/me wants a view and a few adapters) Please refrain from pointing and laughing, but if you have some useful tips, I'm all ears. I really should know better than to post this. Really. Please, don't start a big flame war. But, I peer over the fence from time to time skim through some tutorials and demos on Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails in particular, and one of the things that puts me off it (aside from the sunk cost of my Python knowledge and the fact that my favourite open source CMS project uses Python), is that ... it's so ... ugly. I have an in-built aversion to blocks that end with an end keyword. Call it prejudice. I once learnt Visual Basic. Maybe that's it, but there are also lots of strange symbols flying about. $`? If someone has seen the beauty in Ruby, please enlighten me. I genuinely believe that code asthetics are important in motivating programmers, ensuring consistency, catching mistakes and ultimately producing better software. Of course this is totally subjective. But some good examplse of elegance and aesthetics would be nice. One of the interesting fallouts from the recent discussions about Nuxeo moving CPS over to Java in the future, is whether relying on tools like IDEs is legitimate, and indeed whether this is just excuse-making for the deficiencies of a language. I'd argue that it doesn't matter. Whether you call it a language or a tool is largely moot. We don't edit Python in ed, we use vim or Emacs or TextMate (sensible people use the latter). Some languages are complemented well by tools, others have less need for them, and some just don't have very good tools available. The important metric is how efficient you are within your working environment, taken as a whole to include your language, your framework and your full toolchain. Therefore, the learning curve = the language + the tool . If getting the tools set up is going to take you a long time, you lose productivity. Eclipse is fairly easy going. Some of the plug-ins are a pain to get and install, others are a breeze. But move down one level, and it can become a pain to manage builds with Maven (which is very powerful but can also be very complex when you step outside the box a little) or Ant (which is not that complicated, but requires a fair bit of manual work). I know companies that invest two weeks of a team's time just to get the build environment set up and configured right, which surely is wrong. And secondly - when the tool does the wrong thing, you probably still need to understand what's going on. That complexity that the tool was hiding is rarely hidden completely, forever, because at some point your tool doesn't yet support the thing you need to do. And in many cases, the tool then expects to manage your source code in its own way and either stomps on your changes or breaks utterly. Good tool design, it seems, is not much easier than good language design. There are still some things I miss in my current, very minimal Python set-up (consisting of Python, Terminal.app, TextMate, Firefox, FireBug), such as code-completion and support for refactoring by finding and modifying code that needs changing because I renamed a function or moved it up or down the inheritance hierachy. But in most cases, Python is high-level enough that the tools I need are in the language itself, saving me from having to learn a whole new tool. And in the meantime, I just love doing this: $ cd Products $ mate CMFPlone CMFCore CMFDefault ATContentTypes This opens TextMate with all those directories in a project, and I can grep (Cmd+Shift+F), edit, read, svn (Ctrl+Shift+A), add and remove files and do everything else I need. The alternative is to start Eclipse, find the right workspace, and add the particular folder to a project (or open an existing one). Thanks, but by the time Eclipse has loaded, I'm already onto my next task. :) I'm going to argue out of ignorance. I am not nearly as close to the Nuxeo guys as I am to many other Zope people, and I don't have very much direct experience with CPS at all. However, I want to speculate a bit about the recent announcement that Nuxeo 5 (which is basically the evolution from CPS 4) will be 100% J2EE, in light of some realities that are abundantly clear at my existing employer. CPS always felt a bit reclusive in the Zope world. Florent, Leonnart, Jean-Marc and Tariq (I probably spelled half of those wrong) were visible in the Zope 2, CMF and Five spheres, and I really like them and their work. However, CPS itself was (is) one of things that we often thought, \"oh, it's really powerful and good\" but never really used. Maybe it's because I don't speak French. Maybe it's because I'm addicted to the Plone community. But CPS was (is) Nuxeo's baby and business model. Which is perfectly, perfectly fine (and it's still fully open source, as will Nuxeo 5 be). Florent and Leonnart in particular contributed tons to CMF, Five and other parts of the stack. But it's these contributions we'll miss (presuming they stop, which I hope they don't), not the CPS-specific Zope technology that we never much re-used (or got around to looking at, perhaps). I've been doing some J2EE work lately. There are things that are quite good about it, and there are things that are not. The Nuxeo 5 FAQ says that Java can be pleasurable with the right tool support. Maybe, but I can count on all my hands and toes the number of hours I've lost to trying to get the build system to play ball, configuring various tools and plug-ins, and debugging strange errors in non-readable code. I'm sure it'd be much better if I worked with Java day in, day out, got tons of training and had it all laid out for me by a standard build that some soul had spent months setting up and testing. At my employer, that'll never be the reality. I have some particular beef with JSF (Java Server Faces). It may be the best Java's got for web UI, but it's still painfully slow and often unpredictable (I see some component tree state caches that don't invalidate properly, for example). It does not play well with JSP at all. Java Facelets help, and even have METAL-style macros, but don't even think of showing a complex JSF-based UI to a web designer. It's hard to know where the line between HTML and JSF components go, and JSF components still involve writing HTML to an output stream with Java code (they say they're working on it). I'm sure I just don't understand it, but I have seen supposedly cutting-edge JSF work (in Alfresco), and it's still awkard (single templates having a myriad of responsibilities). The reason that I don't understand it because the stack is a mile high. JSF builds on JSP builds on servlets builds on streams builds on ... EJBs are just scary. Hibernate is quite good, actually, but I found it hard to debug. I'm quite quick at picking up new technologies, but the amount of technologies I have to understand to be productive is so large. I really wanted to use Spring, but that was another book to read. Again, if I did it day in day out and could affort to take a month on a training course or two, I'd probably do fine, but it's not the reality. Will Nuxeo's programmers be happier with Java? Perhaps so, it may fit their brains well. They may find that it pays back in terms of stability, predictability and scalability (I'm somewhat sceptical of those arguments). They will certainly find it easier to hire new, talented developers. But I can't help suspect that this has a lot to do with commercial realities. Alfresco has created a lot of noise off a product that's very, very impressive on paper and reasonably impressive on screen. It doesn't have anywhere near Plone's customisation/application-building story, for example. But if you read the spec list, it includes things like JSR170 and JSR168. Java standards (supposedly) for content storage and portlets, respectively. It talks to Lucene and Hibernate and MyFaces and MySQL, it uses Spring. These are things that are often singled out as \"best-of-breed\" open source components. A digression... the Open Source in Java Enterprise world is bit of a parallel universe to the one we know in Zope and Plone. Different kinds of people hang out there. Investment comes from heavy-weights and Sun specification working groups. Apache/Jakarta are kings (and they have a lot of very, very impressive software)... end digession... But Gartner goes out and says, \"demand JSR170 to avoid lock-in\". The ZODB makes IT managers quiver (call it an object store, not a database, Matt Hammilton says). Butler says, \"demand JSR168 to integrate your applications with your portal server\". IBM tell you, maybe it'll even work. We have viewlets and component architectures that make those things seem like last year's fashion, but that isn't what people buying IT look for. And probably for good reason. They shouldn't invest their money in unproven solutions, hard-to-integrate platforms or dying products. It's often a lot of money on the table, and being conservative is often a good thing (whether they always get what the bought is another story). So, for Nuxeo, I'm sure that their clients will be very much more impressed if the 10 minute PowerPoint sales pitch includes a number of technologies they have heard about. It makes a lot of sense, especially since their stated target is the ECM sphere, and I'm guessing their customers have a lot of similar Java technologies already deployed. And I am really glad that there will be a credible alternative to Alfresco in the Java-based ECM/DMS market. As far as Plone is concerned, I think our edge will always be in flexibility and agility. I can do things with Plone much faster than I can with any other platform, and I can develop cleaner, better-tested components using Zope 3 technologies than any other platform I've ever seen. At the same time, people like Enfold are doing incredible things with integration, and Plone 3.0 should put us back on the innovation curve with exciting new tools and technologies. Mostly, I'm not worried because the Plone community is so vibrant, with so many cool people and such a lot of friendship. In open source, this is worth more than technology. But at the same time, I'm very eager to find out what Nuxeo's very talented developers will manage to come up with. Hopefully, I'll have a chance to sit down with them over a drink and get their experiences straight from the horse's mouth. Nuxeo.com/org have a commercial story to tell. I wish them the best of luck. Sometimes doing debugging through-the-web is unavoidable. Templates are a prime example - I just spent the better part of two hours trying to work out why my use of metal:macro was not playing ball with a Five browser view (hint: understand what macro you're actually calling...). Sometimes I also simply don't know enoug about how something works to write a reliable and more easily debuggable test, and some trial-and-error is needed. A few things can make it more bearable, though: Customise default_error_message . That is, go to portal_skins/plone_templates in the ZMI and customise this template. Remove the call to metal:use-macro=\"here/main_template/macros/main\" . Why? Because rendering Plone's full 404 template takes a few seconds on my machine. For some reason, this template has always been dog slow. For debugging, all you care about is the error message. By not referencing main_template , you get a plain-text error message, which renders instantly. While you're at it, change &lt;dd translate=\"\" content=\"structure err_value\"&gt; to &gt;dd translate=\"\" content=\"err_value\"&gt; , removing the structure keyword. This gives you a plain-text error message, which will not hide thing slike in when the browser things its HTML. Add an external method with a pdb break point. e.g. I have Extensions/debug.py , which contains only: def debug(self): import pdb; pdb.set_trace() Then, either in the portal_skins/custom folder or just the root of the Plone site, add an External Method in the ZMI, with name debug-ex , module debug , method debug . With this in place, you can go to http://localhost:8080/Plone/foo/debug-ex . Make sure you run Zope in the foreground ( zopectl fg ). Your browser will hang, but on the console that you launched Zope, you will get a pdb session, where self refers to the current context (i.e. foo in the URL above). Here, you can do whatever you want, such as inspect the object or mutate it. Remember, you can import other code, call protected methods - do pretty much anything you can do on the interpreter shell. Type pp to pretty-print a variable or an expression. Type c and press Enter to get your browser back. If you're using a Five browser view with a template (either via the template argument to the ZCML directive or via an explicitly invoked ViewPageTemplateFile / ZopeTwoPageTemplateFile , remember that this does not have security assertions the way .pt files in portal_skins does. That is, you can do things like: tal:content=\"python:foo._secretVariable.__of__(context).aq_chain\" So long as you're in debug mode, the you can reload the page and see the output of that statement. This is quite useful for trying things out and quick-inspecting variables. Be ruthless with pdb. Sometimes you are wondering how something works deep inside Zope. So long as you revert your changes afterwards, you can put a pdb statement almost anywhere. For example, whilst debugging a security problem, enable verbose-security in zope.conf and try to put a pdb statement in AccessControl.ImplPython.validate() . You'll have to restart Zope obviously for this to take effect... Interleave your work. Sometimes, you need to restart Zope. This is slow. :) Learn to do two things at once, e.g. work on improving tests for other parts of the code, writing new interfaces or updating documentation while Zope is restarting, or go help someone with their problems on #plone on IRC :)"}

I had a really good weekend, visiting with friends on Friday and Saturday evening. Friday night Susan came over and we looked at her virus protection on her laptop. Joining the crew was Dave and Sandy. Dave also brought his brand-new Dell laptop computer running Windows 7. We unpacked the laptop and got everything set up for him. This all over pizza, and in time to watch the Penguins play..... basically geek heaven. Saturday night my old friend Mark and his family came over and we went to dinner at Damon's restaurant. It has probably been 12 or 13 years since I've eaten at a Damon's restaurant, it was really good and the service was good too. Mark brought down three new Penguins game jerseys, a Jordan Staal and Sidney Crosby for me and a Sidney Crosby for my other friend Dave.....

'Theft' of Sidney Crosby's equipment solved I am glad to hear that Sidney Crosby's gear was found and will be returned to him. Hopefully it makes it into the hockey Hall of Fame where it belongs.

The mayor of Pittsburgh has declared a state of emergency in advance of flooding. Hopefully people are prepared, Especially those in flood prone areas. The weather forecast is expecting rain the next few days on top of melting snows in the higher elevations.....

Now that the weather is getting nicer I plan on being outside more as soon as the 1 foot of snow and ice melt off of my back deck.... Reebok Canada to pay for return of Crosby's equipment Reebok is offering a $10,000 reward for the no questions return of Sidney Crosby's Olympic gloves and hockey stick.

Whoever has his equipment should just return it, do the right thing! It's a piece of Canadian history and I'm sure Crosby would like to have it back.

{"id": "bag-308", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "Earlier I wrote a few paragraphs entitled Why Guys Who Watch Porn Will Never Get Married. The title was admittedly inaccurate and was used to grab the attention of the reader. The purpose of the post was to expose what is often hidden behind all the supposed glamour of porn and how porn negatively impacts relationships. But the post was incomplete as it left no hope for the one who struggles and may have conveyed that they are trapped in this sin. \n\nSo we ask, why do those who sin have hope(and not just with porn but a host of heart sins which affect relationship - words, lack of forgiveness, envy, greed, etc)? Where do they find encouragement? We want to look at just two places from Scripture.\n\nFirst, in 1 Corinthians 6.9-11 Paul lists a number of sins, among them sexually immorality, greed, drunkenness and slander. Is the believer ever trapped? Paul writes: And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\n\nThere is hope which begins with our standing before God. We are a changed people in His sight - we are washed (cleansed), sanctified (set apart, made holy), justified (given a righteous standing before God because of Jesus). It would seem strange that someone who struggles with sexual immorality would never be able to grow in holiness and therefore, never grow more and more conformed to their standing before God. This gives the believer great hope because the change will not ultimately come because we change ourselves but simply and profoundly, because God will change us. God within us through His Spirit will grow us in holiness. This change is often gradual and therefore the believer must continually come back to the cross, being reminded of God's work in us. God will mercifully and graciously discipline us so we become more like our Father in heaven.\n\nSecond, Romans 6 tells us that we are no longer slaves to sin but slaves to righteousness. The good news here is not only is God working on our behalf, but humanly speaking, God gives us means to strengthen our resolve to walk in holiness. We are not powerless and the grip of sin is never stronger than the grip of God. And so the person struggling with porn, words, envy, greed or anger is able to bow before a sovereign God pleading mercy and then rise, using God-given resources to battle unrighteousness.\n\nAnd so, is there hope? Absolutely. It is an amazing paradox that in the glamour of porn we find death and in the horror of Christ's death we find life."}

Then try face exercises for men!\n\nIn today's society there are many men that apparently have no idea that they can build a masculine face using face exercises for men! There are plenty of face and neck exercises that can provide men some truly effective ways for helping to sculpt, tone and define all of your facial features. What's more is that these face exercises you can sculpt a chiseled jawline and even help to define and enhance your cheekbones in only a matter of weeks!\n\nYou should try to think of face exercises in the same manner that body builders use bodybuilding techniques to help build practically any part of their bodies. I mean,there are over 56 muscles in the face. If you don't think that you can build your facial muscles, then you are seriously mistaken!\n\nBecause the very same principles used in bodybuilding are also used in facial exercises. When used routinely, here's what you can expect from face exercises for men:\n\n*You can help to enhance your jawline! Face and neck exercises have been proven to help a man create a chiseled jawline through jawline exercises.\n\n*You can even help to define your chin area. You can help the chin to get more developed through proper exercises.\n\n*You can help to reduce a double chin. This one benefit alone had so many men jump on the men's facial exercise bandwagon!\n\n*You can help to eliminate bags under the eyes. Yes, you can even help to get rid of fatigue from under the eyes. This is the same type of fatigue that makes a man look much older than he actually is. This type of nagging condition can actually be decreased greatly by using proper facial exercise techniques!\n\nHere are some tips you can try right NOW to help you get more masculine facial features right away!\n\n1. Start by taking your middle finger and placing it on your chin.\n\n2. Next, proceed to put your lips over both your upper and your lower teeth.\n\n3. Then you just want to slightly open your mouth about half way, keeping it there in this position for about 20 to 40 seconds on each rep. Be sure to hold it in a strong hold, really feeling your jawline beginning to form more tightly.\n\n4. That's it!\n\nThis exercises will not only help you to achieve a more masculine,chiseled jawline, but it will also help you to develop and build a more masculine looking face!\n\nI mean, you can even help to enhance your cheekbones greatly by performing these isometric facial exercises for men. This is great news for any man that wants to help better himself and ultimately wants to help himself look better."}

And conditional random fields. And our problems are a lot harder than binary classification. And there are standard data sets that we've been evaluating on for decades and continue to evaluate on (I'm channeling Bob here :P). But there's one thing that happens, the difference of which is so striking, that I'd like to call it to center stage. It has to do with \"messing with our inputs.\" I'll spend a bit more time describing the vision approach, since it's probably less familiar to the average reader. Suppose I'm trying to handwriting recognition to identify digits from zero to nine (aka MNIST). I get, say, 100 labeled zeros, 100 labeled ones, 100 labeled twos and so on. So a total of 1000 data points. I can train any off the shelf classifier based on pixel level features and get some reasonable performance (maybe 80s-90s, depending). Now, I want to insert knowledge. The knowledge that I want to insert is some notion of invariance. I.e., if I take an image of a zero and translate it left a little bit, it's still a zero. Or up a little bit. Of if I scale it up 10%, it's still a zero. Or down 10%. Or if I rotate it five degrees. Or negative five. All zeros. Same hold for all the other digits. One way to insert this knowledge is to muck with the learning algorithm. That's too complicated for me: I want something simpler. So what I'll do is take my 100 zeros and 100 ones and so on and just manipulate them a bit. That is, I'll sample a random zero, and apply some small random transformations to it, and call it another labeled example, also a zero. Now I have 100,000 training points. I train my off the shelf classifier based on pixel level features and get 99% accuracy or more. The same trick works for other vision problem (eg., recognizing animals). (This process is so common that it's actually described in Chris Bishop's new-ish PRML book!)"}

Many companies complain about how poor their websites are at generating sales - often weak copy is to blame.\n\nHere are a few classic corporate web copywriting mistakes you might want to point out:\n\nIrrelevant copy that wastes visitors\u2019 time \u2013 You know the sort, packed with meaningless marketing clich\u00e9s \u2013 \u2018paradigm shift\u2019, \u2018modular best of breed solutions\u2019, blah, blah, blah\u2026Copy that\u2019s not focused on the reader is more likely to cause yawns and glazed eyes than people hopping in theirs seats about a product\u2019s benefits.\n\nNo structure or call to action \u2013 Every page should have an point of what it wants the reader to think or do. Rather than endlessly boast about \u2018market leading solutions\u2019, the copy should be creating an image in people\u2019s minds of how a product can solve their problem. As you know, hitting people\u2019s emotional buttons is a time proven way of persuading them to respond to a call to action (which is another key element many corporate web page\u2019s are missing).\n\nCopywriting by committee \u2013 In theory, asking people from different areas of a company to contribute to what the website needs to say makes sense. But you then often end up with the website\u2019s copy becoming drowned in track changes and amendments. Yes, getting feedback is important. But it should then be one person\u2019s responsibility to pull all the elements together into a concisely written website page.\n\nCopy pasted from the corporate brochure \u2013 People skim read online and have the attention spans of goldfish. So web copy needs to use short sentences, short paragraphs, plenty of subheads, bullet pointed lists and provide succinct, usable summaries. The internet is also a robotic medium. So addressing the reader as \u2018you\u2019 and writing copy in an approachable tone can help it sound more human. Ideally, pages should be kept to less than 300 words. You can always use arrows or drill down menus to break up long pages into more digestible chunks.\n\nHasn\u2019t been split tested \u2013 Not sure which headline or call to action works best? Try split testing the page to find out. Google\u2019s Website Optimizer will do the trick.\n\nToo many keywords (or not enough) \u2013 SEO is a complicated beast, and has evolved a lot since the days of hidden text and keyword stuffing. But you still need enough words in the right places to make sure Google knows what your page is about. Luckily, there are some great tools out there for finding out whether your copy\u2019s on the right track - SEOBugz is one tool I use regularly.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve got a spare window next week, have a look at corporate websites in your area to see which are making these mistakes to drum up some business.\n\nAny corporate web copywriting mistakes you\u2019d add?"}

The Department of Interior has been considering listing the Greater Sage Grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus - above) under the Endangered Species Act, and last Friday it announced its decision. Beyond their spectacle and interesting biology, Sage Grouse are notable for being completely dependent on the sagebrush steppes that covered much of the western United States until recently. As livestock grazing, development and extractive industries degraded these communities, a population of around 16 million birds has dwindled to well under 5% of that number today. Halting the grouse decline means maintaining healthy, virgin sagebrush habitat and disallowing the practices, essential to continual economic growth, that destroy them. The situation is a microcosm of the global conservation situation: meaningful conservation and the paradigm of continued economic growth are incompatible. This incompatibility is the metaphorical elephant in the sitting room of public conservation discourse. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar's limp-wristed decision last Friday, to assign the Sage Grouse \u201cwarranted but precluded\u201d status (meaning essentially that the bird deserves protection, but won't get it, although its status will be re-reviewed annually), is a clear sign that moneyed interests will continue their reign and the DOI intends to continue denying that elephant. For more on sage brush ecology and conservation, see here, here, here, and here . The second story describes the rediscovery of the \u201cextinct\u201d Australian Yellow-spotted Bell Frog ( Litoria castanea \u2013 above), which hadn't been seen since 1980. Six tadpoles were collected and transferred to the Taronga Zoo near Sydney, where a captive propagation effort will be implemented. This species and several close relatives, all found in the southeastern quadrant of the continent, are rather hard to untangle taxonomically. The whole complex has seen a rather steep population decline in recent years, the causes of which are not clear, although chytridiomycosis has been implicated, as have chemical pollutants and invasive Gambusia fish. The Yellow-spotted Bell Frog's small range in the highlands of SE Australia is not well-studied, and contrary to the popular press implication, it was never declared extinct because the possibility of this news has always been considered very real. The discovery of this population, and the hope it represents for survival of this species, while happy news, tells us nothing about the broader picture of worldwide frog decline. _____________________ upper: WINTER SAGE GROUSE (1989) acrylic 14\" x 14\" lower: Photo of Litoria castanea by AP, lifted from the Internet The time has come, once again, for one of the country's biggest sale exhibitions of small artworks.

Among the 150 or so paintings on view will be my Red-breasted Paradise Kingfisher (above). _____________________ illustration: RED-BREASTED PARADISE KINGFISHER (2010) acrylic 10\" x 8\" I'll say it again: the paucity of good mainstream science journalism is more than regrettable. Science blogs represent the best source for intelligent assessment of science news, but sorting the good ones from the bad can be a trick. So I was pleased to serve as a judge for the latest Open Laboratory , a compendium of the best science blogging of 2009. It's now available in print for $14.50 or as a pdf download for $7.50. Few species have been featured on this blog more than California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus). There is no better school for conservation than the struggle over the past few decades to find a way to support these birds on a continent that no longer harbors much of a home for them. The recent trend has been a hopeful one; from a mere 22 individuals in the early '80s, a concerted management program has lifted the tally to nearly 350, over half of which live free in a sort of 3/4-wild state. Some bad news arrived yesterday, of the recent deaths of three members of the Arizona population. All three had succumbed to lead poisoning, a persistent plague in the region. The entire population was trapped and subjected to chelation therapy a few years ago, but obviously, more needs to be done. The Arizona and Utah Departments of Fish &amp; Wildlife are stepping up efforts to change the habits of local hunters, including handing out coupons for free non-toxic ammunition. _____________________ illustration: CALIFORNIA CONDOR (2008) acrylic 30\" x 20\" One of my perennially favorite themes is the taking of outsize quarry by predatory birds. I was recently alerted to a couple of nice documentations, the first describing an apparent case of a Spectacled Owl ( Pulsatrix perpicillata ) preying on a Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth ( Bradypus variegatus ) that had come to the ground to defecate. Spectacled Owls are common through most of tropical America, although I've never found a nest nor handled one in captivity and have little knowledge of their behavior. They're medium-sized forest owls that I've always assumed subsisted mostly on lizards, arthropods and mouse-sized mammals. A grounded three-toed sloth is hardly an imposing foe (unlike its rather distant cousins the two-toed sloths), but the taking of anything that big by a Spectacled is quite surprising to me. Our second link documents an attemped predation on a White-tailed Deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) by a Golden Eagle ( Aquila chrysaeto s), featuring some great shots accompanied by somewhat less great commentary, said to have been taken in Illiniois, of all places. While this behavior isn't typical, it's far from unheard of. It can't be denied that Golden Eagles are very powerful and effective predators. I have spent many hours watching wild Golden Eagles and have watched them hunt many different types of quarry. Some day I hope to witness something like this in person. While on the subject of large prey, I received an email yesterday with a series of photographs showing a Black-headed Python ( Aspidites melanocephalus ) swallowing what appears to be a dull-colored Gould's Monitor ( Varanus gouldii ). The email identified the location as Cloudbreak, Arizona, although it's clearly Australia. These photos may not be new, but they were of special interest to me, since they illustrate a situation similar to the one I painted in 1994 for the cover of Brian Kend's Pythons of Australia . My painting was criticized for showing the snake applying its belly to the prey instead the sides of its body. Some of the photographs, like the one in the upper left, clearly show the python using its sides, while in others the belly is against the prey. The entire photo series appears to show the process at a later stage than my painting (the prey seems to have already been killed in the former), but hope remains that Kend's book cover may actually be somewhat accurate. _____________________ upper: SPECTACLED OWL (2009) acrylic 10\" x 8\" I was asked the other day about the veracity of the cover of my book, Rigor Vitae . The painting (above) shows a trio of African Softshell Turtles ( Trionyx triunguis ) startled from their perch atop the back of a Hippopotamus ( Hippopotamus amphibius ) that appears to be lurching in a threatening way towards an unknown target. So how representative of reality is this painting? I can best answer this question be retracing my thinking in its conception. The adjectives that spring to mind when I think of softshell turtles are: active, fast, graceful, and above all, intelligent (as turtles go). The species T. triunguis is one of the smartest of the bunch; observations in both wild and captive specimens have shown they can spend over half their waking time engaged in play behavior. Even though this consists of underwater, hunting-related exercises, the knowledge inspired me to approach the piece with an air of whimsy. In my work, I nearly always try to deal with truths of natural history, but different truths call for different approaches. More often than not, the approach is a direct sort of story-telling that's not difficult to understand. When I invent a situation I've never seen nor heard of, biological credibility is an important consideration. The initial idea of this painting, African Softshells basking on a Hippo, is just such a situation, and the placing of my protagonists on that platform was done with a clear conscience. Although they spend a great deal of time basking, I don't feel that this static activity defines softshells' essence well at all. The painting called for fury and for speed, so I set the whole thing in motion, in that instant of my initial basking concept's irrevocable replacement with an absent hippo and the turtles returned to their brisk native depths. Caught in midair, the main subject's placement strains the limits of credibility, especially considering the fact he'd be more likely to favor a quick downward slide. In placing him, I tried to find the highest conceivable point such a reptile could reach if all factors of friction and inertia could be favorably aligned. The entire composition is built around enforcing the painting's movement: the surface ripples, the Papyrus stems, the flock of St. Helena Waxbills, and a mysterious arc of water all cooperate in a scene theoretically possible, yet so unlikely as to disqualify it as an illustration of animal behavior. But is it a betrayal of my \u201cnatural history truth\u201d objective? I answer with a firm \u201cNo.\u201d Exaggerated, contrived and skewed, I could never create a painting containing more truth about African Softshells. Anthropomorphism is a present danger whenever engaging in such exaggeration. My rule of thumb is to take care when when comparing a non-human's behavior to my own, but when the situation is reversed to throw caution to the wind. Emotions and instincts are identical in some cases, analogous in the rest, and indulging instincts accords a certain satisfaction. In Call of the Monsoon (above), a Couch's Spadefoot ( Scaphiopus couchii ) rises from subterranean summertime torpor to feed and breed in the monsoon moisture. Again, the subject's position here is anatomically possible, yet not typical, even a bit exaggerated: a bit like a purring cat. The intent is to stretch the immediate truth a bit to express a greater truth than a photographic representation could, without falling into the mire of anthropomorphism. _____________________ upper: HIPPOPOTAMUS &amp; NILE SOFTSHELL TURTLES (1995) acrylic 20\" x 30\" lower: CALL OF THE MONSOON--COUCH'S SPADEFOOT (1996) acrylic 18\" x 12\" WHO PUT THE \"GATE\" IN THE CLIMATEGATE? Memories of the Copenhagen climate summit have dissipated with the contrails of the jets carrying the delegates back home, but the public discourse continues. For now we put the important talk on hold in favor of a silly strawman: the debate over climatological data. Special thanks to my right-wing pals D, J and S for keeping me abreast of the latest articles, blog posts and email forwards making the case that the evidence showing a general anthropogenic warming of the earth over the past 50 years is a hoax, disingenuously cobbled together by various entities of bad intent. Over the past year, I've studied their arguments, and regret to report that it's pretty weak stuff, misunderstanding the research at best, but more often intentionally misrepresenting it to support the preconceived resolution that the earth's climate is not warming, and even if it was, it wasn't caused by humans, and even if it was, it would make things better, not worse. I have a few arguments with the major voices on the other side, too, and will voice those in future posts, but for now, let's ask how we can get past this argument and why we haven't yet. Any discussion of climate change has policy implications, and it's only natural for one's political desires to color one's sight. Also, climatology is a difficult science to understand, involving lots of sophisticated statistics, and understanding it takes some work. Most science is sort of like looking at a yard through a picket fence; you can get a fairly good idea of what's back there, but you have to make some assumptions about what you can't see, some of which will likely be wrong. Looking through a single gap will yield a false impression. It can be tempting to consider each gap, seeking the one that best represents your assumptions about the yard, but that's a sure recipe for self-delusion. Only by taking them all into consideration will you approach a true understanding. Last, the sad paucity of good science journalism makes it extremely hard for us layfolks to keep up. I keep waiting for Science or Nature or even the Journal of Applied Meteorology to turn up on the racks at the local Barnes &amp; Noble, to no avail. Peer-reviewed science journals, like Medieval bibles, are not meant for proletariat eyes. As an example of mainstream science journalism at its worst, I offer a tidbit from last Sunday's Daily Mail , the UK's 2 nd most widely-read daily paper. It describes a BBC interview with Phil Jones, the director of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU), the group whose emails were hacked and made public on the eve of the international climate summit in Copenhagen. For those interested in wading through them, the emails can be accessed here . The evidence in these emails has been heralded as a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d proving the following wrongdoing by CRU researchers: 1. Attempting to bar research conflicting with their own from peer-reviewed journals. 2. Hiding incriminating evidence. 3. Manipulating data showing a cooling trend to make that trend disappear. Without going into depth, I'll just say that #1 was clearly discussed, although there's no evidence any action was ever taken. The evidence for #2 looks fairly damning\u2014exactly what was deleted and what, if any, rules were broken remains unclear, at least to me. Jones says it was done out of frustration with a deluge of FOI requests that were impeding the actual work of the laboratory. The evidence for #3 is extremely weak, and can be interpreted in many ways. Overall, \u201cClimategate,\u201d as it's been dubbed, falls far short of discrediting any of the CRU's work, much less climatology in general. I hope you can take the time to read the Daily Mail article along with the original interview it claims to describe. While the Daily Mail headline states that Dr. Jones \u201cadmits there has been no global warming since 1995,\u201d what he clearly says is that the data for that period are insufficient to make statistical sense of. Imagine a white wall with three small chips in its paint. Two chips show blue paint underneath, one shows red paint. Your data suggest that more of the wall is blue than red, but you have no idea what the true ratio is. This is the climatologist's dilemma. The CRU data appear to suggest a small warming trend from 1995 to the present and a small cooling trend from 2002 to the present, but they have no idea what color that wall is. (Data from other groups, such as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , show slightly higher temperatures, but are still statistically insignificant when isolated). The Daily Mail article also misrepresents Jones' statements about the \u201cMedieval Warming Period\u201d as well as incorrectly suggesting that the CRU's surface temperature data were used to assemble the paleoclimatic model represented in the famous IPCC \u201chockey-stick graph.\u201d It's hard to attribute the libelous errors in this article to a writer's inability to understand his subject. This isn't journalism, it isn't opinion. It's propaganda intended not to enlighten but to deceive. It's disheartening to see more and more of this from mainstream news organizations, and to realize that more eyes will read the bogus Daily Mail story than the interview it misrepresents. Climatologists simply try to understand the systems they study; it's plain to see from which side the real climatology hoax is perpetrated. _____________________ illustration: LESSER FLAMINGOS (2005) oil on canvas 72\" x 96\" At a party a couple of weeks back, I got into a discussion with an \u201cevolution skeptic,\u201d who trotted out that aggravating old line that evolution was only a \u201ctheory.\u201d He, it seemed, was holding out for the day that the theory would be passed into \u201claw.\u201d This inspired me to offer a humble birthday present to good old Charles Darwin on his 201 st birthday: A very quick, very unsophisticated primer on the difference between theory and a law. A law is basically an observation of nature, and a theory explains an observation. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation described the force of gravity, and his Theory of Gravitation, which has largely been superseded by Einsteins Theory of General Relativity, attempted to explain it. In this manner, the Law of Evolution could be stated that organisms change morphologically over time. Darwin's Theory of Mutation and Natural Selection explains the mechanics of that change. Theories don't become laws, they modify them. Class dismissed. Illustrating this post is a new painting of a Red-bellied Paradise Kingfisher ( Tanysiptera nympha ), one of six members of a New Guinean complex of streamer-tailed forest birds. It was in this region that Alfred Russell Wallace saw such simple island speciation and began to understand how it worked, just as speciation on the Galapagos awakened Darwin to the same ideas. _____________________ illustration: RED-BELLIED PARADISE KINGFISHER (2010) acrylic on clay board 10\" x 8\""}
{"id": "bag-149", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "GEORGE LUCAS GONNA SUE SOMEBODY\n\n\n++++++++UPDATE:+++++\nI checked out a few boards last nite and it seems this latest post has rubbed some folks the wrong way. Let me try to address here some of the most common complaints some of the game forum folks seem to be having.\n\n#1- I AM NOT SUE HAPPY- I have never sued anyone and unless someone really steps over the line, I look at lawsuits as a last line of defense. Trust me, as someone who gone thru the process of being sued, the whole thing is a nasty, nasty, expensive business and it seems- to me- that it is meant to be. Like burying someone, divorce, our complicated tax system, and so many other institutions of our society that are important but more and more just seem like they exist for the sake of big business, there's a whole lot of people with expensive suits and expensive degrees who make a crap ton of cash off lawsuits. And I sure as hell don't want to contribute to their bottom line. And that is why I suggested sending a letter. I would guess in 99% of cases like this, no one is out to harm anyone else. It is simply a misunderstanding or an oversight that, when brought to light, could be corrected. I harbor no ill will or resentment towards the people making SCRAP METAL or the people making WAR OF THE GODS. They both sound like products right up my alley and I will be purchasing a download and a ticket to each one, respectively, once they hit...whatever their names end up being. \n\n#2- YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT AT COPYRIGHT LAW AND NEITHER AM I- I know experts in copyright law (I actually do) and you, sir, are not an expert in copyright law. With the exception of MAYBE .1% of the people who are even aware of this discussion we are having, you don't know if my claims have merit in court and neither do I. And frankly, just because you or I think we are right on this, there is no real right or wrong. There is a judge who decides if there is a case and if there is, then there is a jury who decides who wins the case. And there is a lot of gray area simply because- while the law is very concrete- the subjective interpretation of that law requires a human brain. I can tell you that when I saw the titles, they rubbed me the wrong way and seemed worth mentioning. I can live with the fact that I could be wrong and I can live with the fact that most folks may not agree with me. This doesn't make me an idiot and it doesn't make you a genius. YOU go spend your precious time on this planet working with others and giving everything you've got to create some intellectual property and I assure you, you will feel protective of it. Again, being protective does not mean my assumption that these titles cross the line is right. But being a smarmy asshole- like a good % of board posters have been towards me over this issue- doesn't make you right either. It just makes you a smarmy asshole. NOTE: It has been pointed out to me that because my issues are clearly with title and not idea, this is a TRADEMARK LAW issue, not a COPYWRIGHT LAW issue. Fair enough. I stand corrected on the type of law. My comments and thoughts still stand tho. \n\n#3- TONE- See the big Chris Rock picture? You know, the comedian? See the quote from a Kevin Smith movie that I use for the title of this post? See the smiley face at the bottom of this post? People, I'm not on a crazy rampage about this. I never said I was going to sue anyone. I was bringing it up as something that interests me and something I thought would be worth sharing with people who come to this blog to hear about- mainly- my game making life. And I was doing so in a lighthearted manner. I assure you, this is the farthest thing from a big deal in my life. If nothing were to change on this front, I really would not care. \n\n#4- FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK- Finally, for the people who are like, \"JAFFE! GET BACK TO WORK ON YOUR GAME!\"...please, let me assure you, I am working very hard. The team is working very hard. Sony is working very hard. We are all busting ass and- even tho we may not agree on these particular legal issues- we are still eager to entertain each and every one of you with what we've got cooking. Just like you, I don't work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even during my day, I take breaks. But as some of you know, I work at home. So while at your job you may hang in the breakroom with your buddies and chat about last nite's episode of LOST or what game you are playing, I video chat with friends and I blog. Fucking sue me. But the point IS, we are working hard on our game and we're looking forward to showing it to you today on GTTV...oh wait...that's not us :) \n\nOk so that's my update. Thanks for reading. Later.\n\nEND UPDATE:\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nOk, maybe not Lucas but Sony should. Or if I owned the rights to TWISTED METAL and GOD OF WAR, I sure as hell would at the least send a sternly worded legal letter.\n\nHeck, I'd send two legal letters if it were me.\n\nI mean, first Microsoft puts out a car combat game and calls it SCRAP METAL?\n\nHey, looks like a great game! Right up my alley! Day one purchase for me. But come on guys, isn't that just a little too close to Sony's own car combat game TWISTED METAL?\n\nAnd then Sony has GOD OF WAR, a game and potential movie about mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods. And then this movie gets announced called WAR OF THE GODS about- yep!- mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods. \n\nAnd look: Sony doesn't- and should not- own the concept of the Greek Myths. Nor should they own the idea of mortal fighting ancient Gods, Greek or any other kind. That's all public domain stuff. But the TITLE? Sony DOES own that. And GOD OF WAR/WAR OF THE GODS seem a little too close to comfort ya'll.\n\nAnyway, like I said, not my fight. I don't own shit! :)\n\nDavid"}
{"id": "bag-2819", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "I'm pretty excited about this. Leave it to HBS to come up with the MBA Oath. Money quote (emphasis added): \"One of Jeff Skilling's classmates has recalled a comment the ex-CEO of Enron made during a class about a dangerous consumer product: \"I'd keep making and selling [it]. My job as a business man is to...maximize return to the shareholders. It's the government's job to step in if a product is dangerous.\" As a student today at Harvard's business school, I hear echoes of those comments from my classmates .\" Yikes. The author goes on: \"In their reverence for the individual, business schools are remarkably bad at creating a sense of common purpose beyond an ambition to make money. Without a higher calling, bad actors flourish and those who want to speak out against them have little basis on which to challenge them.\" With much love to my HBS chums, this is not the way things are at all top business schools. And honestly, I can't imagine that (outside of a small, perhaps vocal element) that this isn't what it's really like at HBS either...is it? This is the second in a three part review of my favorite 10 shows of the decade that was. I've figured out the last show to include, but I'll save that for another post so I don't drown everybody with words. 5/05 Shins in OKC\u2014A very nice show (Shins sound live exactly like they do on record) that was nicer because I was there enjoying it with Lauren. We hadn\u2019t been dating that long at that point, and we drove up with our friends Bill and Rick. We all made it back to Ft Sill the next day to attend my Hail and Farewell from the Army. I was allowed a speech, and as many know I enjoy (a bit too much) any chance to be on the microphone. My speech that day concluded with: \u201cPeace in the middle east, no blood for oil, I\u2019m out!\u201d and made a lot of people mad. It also caused one of my fellow officers, a 6 foot 5, 280 lbs black guy, to tell me that I was \u201cone funky Caucasian\u201d. Good times. Lauren and I wrapped up the weekend with a going away party at Rick\u2019s place. Great weekend, and the Shins were a big part of it. 08/04 Wrens/Magnolia Electric Co in Denton\u2014drove down by myself from Fort Sill to Denton, a city famous for death metal bands and being north of Dallas. I didn\u2019t know anyone so I chatted with either band before the show. Indie shows are cool like that (especially back in 01-05 before indie blew up). Both performances were strong, and it was great to see two of my faves on the same stage. After several beers at the show I slept in my car until the next morning and then drove the 4 hours home. 6/06 Radiohead in Berkeley\u2014The perfect culmination to years of Radiohead hero worship. Memorable because of the beautiful Berkeley summer night, and time spent with friends David Hyman, the Rotblats, and Nate Anthony. If I never see Radiohead again it would be a shame, but I am very cool with this night being my lasting memory of the Radiohead experience. 4/05 Wilco in OKC (2)\u2014Bill Rausch and a sportsjacket. I don\u2019t think I can legally say anything else about this show besides that. (Also, go see Wilco live. It\u2019s expensive to do, nowadays, but it\u2019s worth it.) In no order whatsoever, here is the first half of my live music retrospective on the decade that was. Part 2 will run later in the week. These aren\u2019t necessarily the 10 best shows I saw, but for one reason or another they were the 10 most memorable. (Editors Note\u2014part 2 currently only has 4 shows. If you attended a really memorable show with me in the last 10 years that didn\u2019t make it in this post, please send me some inspiration!!!) 5/03 Built to Spill in LA\u2014I\u2019ve seen these guys more than any other band, and one show had to go on the list. This was easily the best show I\u2019ve seen them play. They closed with a 15 minute version of Cortez the Killer during which Jim Roth did things with his guitar the likes of which I\u2019ve never seen before or since. Epic. I have a poster of this show on the wall of my apartment. 4/06 Daft Punk at Coachella\u2014I was there with several great friends Berkeley friends, to include the Kaplans and Anna Utgoff. DP wasn\u2019t why I went to this festival, but it\u2019s the one thing I\u2019ll never forget about Coachella. This was the first show DP did with their giant laser pyramid (top left). It was as cool as everyone says it was. 12/05 Wrens in SF\u2014I love the Wrens, and they\u2019re always great live. I had seen them maybe 6 months earlier at the Pitchfork Intonation Music Festival in Chicago. At that show, for one song, they brought fans up on stage to play percussion with the band. When that song came up at this show I left my friends (Dan and Kelly) and pushed to the very front. I had a Bruce Springsteen/Courtney Cox moment with a member of the band, and he pulled me on stage with several fellow fans. When the singing came in I did what I do at shows\u2014sang along. The band member, seeing I knew the words and wasn\u2019t a completely awful singer pulled me into the mic so I could sing along with the band. We did it up, back-to-back 80s hair metal style, for the rest of the song. It was probably the coolest moment I\u2019ve ever had at a concert, hands down. 3/06 Magnolia Electric Co/Okkervil River in Austin\u2014At SXSW I won an MBA music case competition with Any, April Chris and Sung Hu. We had no passes (the guys at McCombs let us down) but a couple of us managed to hop the fence at this outdoor set and enjoy two really nice performances. 9/06 Silver Jews in SF\u2014This was a good but unspectactular show on September 10th 2006. I went by myself and had made plans to try to meet up with David H, but he got held up doing other stuff. The show was memorable because I got my letter in the mail from Uncle Sam the next day calling me back to the Army. I saw a few other good shows before I cut myself off from music in 2007 to go overseas (Islands and Phoenix in SF come immediately to mind) but music wasn\u2019t quite the same for me after this show, not for a long while at least. Once upon a time I loved making music lists. Really, really loved it. The problem was that my list skills never quite caught up with my enthusiasm for making them. For example: I spent an entire summer in 2003 trying to come up with a mix CD worth of songs that featured hand clapping. Sounds simple enough, right? But the project never really came together. In my mind, the songs had to be good, satisfactorily indie and/or ironic, and non-obvious enough that I would feel good (and snobby) about attaching my name to the list (so no \u201cTheme from Friends\u201d, etc). The whole thing started when I was driving around Alaska listening to \u201cNothing\u2019severgonnastandinmywayagain\u201d by Wilco, a song I loved (still do) so much that I would take my hands off of the wheel to clap along with the chorus. Same deal for \u201cAlone Down There\u201d by Modest Mouse and Ted Leo's \u201cTimorous Me\u201d. But those three songs ended up as the list. When I couldn\u2019t think of any other songs that really got me excited I brought Megan and her brother Jeff into the conversation, and they had great suggestions that for whatever reason still didn\u2019t quite make me happy. The final analysis: good idea, poor execution. In business school and in Seattle (when I was with Amazon) I made a lot of live music lists in an effort to get people to come to shows with me. It was fun, but didn't work that well either (I went to a lot of shows solo). Putting all that aside, I want to start 2010 with a few music lists for old time's sake. In a couple of days I'll lay out my favorite live music experience of the last 10 years, but tonight I'm going to rank where music fits in with all the other crap going in Exnicios-land circa 2000-2009. We'll call my parents emeritus to this list and not in the official running. Without further ado: 1. Lauren (my beautiful wife) 2. Graduating Duke (and all that went along with it) 3a. Going to war (even if I wasn't getting shot at) 3b. Being in the Army generally (I'm better at push ups and shooting things than I would have been) 5. Graduating from Berkeley (and all that went along with it) 6. Calhoun and Bailey (my dog and cat) 7. Music (only top 7...music's got to feel a little disappointed) 8. All of my other friends and family not captured by Duke, Army, Berkeley, etc. 9. The Washington Redskins (0-1 in the new decade!) 10. All the books I read This is a test.

That means it\u2019s been more than a year since I got home and picked up again with my life with Lauren. In the last 14 months (Nov 2008 until now) we got a dog, had a re-wedding and went to New Zealand. I started working as a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton in March, but not until after I got to say that I was unemployed during the great economic meltdown. All told Lauren and I celebrated 7 other weddings with family and friends (very fun) and had to say goodbye to one of the best guys either of us had ever met (very, very sad). Lauren and I live in Old Town Alexandria, about 5 or 6 miles outside of DC proper. We both work in the District and we\u2019ve settled into a really nice routine. I miss blogging. A lot. I think that I\u2019m not awful at this, and I wish I had been better about writing in 2009. But for some reason it\u2019s been hard for me to look at Army 2.0 for the last year. I don\u2019t know why. In general I\u2019ve had trouble engaging technology. Technology was my entire focus for 2 years at Haas, and I stayed pretty well connected to that world while I was in Afghanistan of all places. Home in DC, I feel more detached from the West Coast than I ever did in the war zone. Weird, I know. Life is great all the same. Lauren and I are really happy. And we\u2019re going to figure the Coast thing soon (by which I mean before Lauren divorces me for indecision). So in conjunction with that decision, here is my 2010 to-do list: 1) Re-engage technology\u2014spend less time reading about NBA teams I don\u2019t care about and more time reading tech blogs 2) Blog a couple of times a week\u2014I appreciate that anything I say now is less interesting than anything I said while on the forward edge of freedom, but still. Writing is fun. 3) For the first time, really embrace Facebook and Twitter\u2014read above\u2026poor, innocent social networking sites have suffered for the same reason my blog has. I am safely home with my family in Northern Virginia. As far as I know I have no further obligation to the Army for the next 6 months, and after that I'll be eligible to resign my commission. Sultan Jeff is home as well, but Chris is still over in Afghanistan. He was the last of my group to arrive, and he'll be the last to come home. Thank you for all of your thoughts, prayers, and well wishes (and clicks and eyeballs and links) over the last 16 months. The blog is not going to go away. We still have VPs to settle on, and the IRR story is something that will continue to develop as we see what direction the wars take under a new president. Thanks again, and I'll talk to everyone soon."}

It was around 5:30 am when we were wating for a cab outside the casino.   She was dressed in her cultural attire, not her workaday business attire.  She's Cherokee.  She was wearing a black leather jacket with the long, thin leather tassles (about a foot long) and asked me to dance to the piped music in the foyer of the casino hotel.  So we did.  I just kinda swayed from side to side as I watched her.  She danced, and the leather tassles just swung in rhythm to her deliberate movements.  Grace.  Wow.  At least I thought so.....we were both well under the influence..\n\nI love her spirituality as well.  She follows traditional native spiritual ideals.  She smudges regularly, participates in sweats.  I know so little of the cultural rituals, although we have discussed them on occasion.  \n\nAnyway, what I am getting at is that there is so much about her I love.  I love that way back when.....at the time when my wife declined so quickly, and then when my son was severely injured, that she was one who I could rely on to give me another perspective.  I only knew her online then.  Four years ago, we started to talk.  Only in the last while did we meet.  She is exactly what she portrayed online, except for the physicality.  We really never discussed that.\n\nSo yes, I love her.  Is this something that will result in us getting together on a permanent basis, type deal?  Likely not.  I love her in that I really care how she is.  When she hurts, I feel it.  When she is happy, it makes me smile.  But it won't likely happen since I can't see our different lives meshing.  I know she knows that too.  It's a different thing than I have experienced before.  Not really sure......who knows."}

It\u2019s hard to describe \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d because few people besides ex-presidents have it anymore, but he did. Ron\u2019s appeal crossed over to all ages. Teens and parents alike thought he was talking directly to them . He was your bud, your kindly uncle, that nice neighbor who paid attention to you when your deadbeat husband didn\u2019t. If Ron Lundy had been on WABC during the MAD MEN era Betty might not have resorted to banging that politician to fill her emotional void. As a broadcaster he was impeccable. Blessed with a rich deep voice he could read copy so convincingly that even I wanted to shop at Korvette\u2019s. I never met Ron Lundy. Didn\u2019t even in live in New York. And yet I feel a huge personal loss. He died too young. He should have at least been 77. Or better yet, 101. So long, Luv. Randy Michaels is the CEO of the Tribune Company. Once a major broadcasting and publishing giant (Chicago Tribune, LA Times, etc.), it is now crumbling like a sand castle. And Michaels, who in a similar role with Clear Channel Communication, laid the groundwork for that empire to collapse. So it\u2019s understandable why Tribune would hire a non-newspaper man to oversee their operation in it's most dire time. Anyway, recently he issued an edict to the news director of WGN radio listing 119 words or phrases WGN newscasters were no longer allowed to say. WGN, Chicago is one of the most respected radio stations in America. I can just see it -- \"Mr. Michaels, the editor of the Los Angeles Times is on line one. He can't meet payroll.\" \"Call them back! I'm busy with something far more important! Let me see... \"pedestrian\". We can't have our newscasters say pedestrian.\" The absurdity continues as Michaels instructed WGN staffers to snitch on each other if they hear one of these dastardly words aired. \" Dan, I know you hired me and rescued my family from financial ruin but you said \"at risk\" on the 5:30 cast so I just sent a text to Randy Michaels.\" Oh, the morale must be sky high. So here is the complete list. And then to help guide the WGN news staff I've written a couple of examples of how news stories should now sound. What can I say ? I'm a giver. \u201cFlee\u201d meaning \u201crun away\u201d \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d news \u201cLaud\u201d meaning \u201cpraise\u201d \u201cSeek\u201d meaning \u201clook for\u201d \u201cSome\u201d meaning \u201cabout\u201d \u201cTwo to one margin\u201d . . . \u201cTwo to one\u201d is a ratio, not a margin. A margin is measured in points. It\u2019s not a ratio. \u201cYesterday\u201d in a lead sentence \u201cYouth\u201d meaning \u201cchild\u201d 5 a.m. in the morning After the break After these commercial messages Aftermath All of you Allegations Alleged Area residents As expected At risk At this point in time Authorities Auto accident Bare naked Behind bars Behind closed doors Behind the podium (you mean lecturn) [sic] Best kept secret Campaign trail Clash with police Close proximity Complete surprise Completely destroyed, completely abolished, completely finished or any other completely redundant use Death toll Definitely possible Diva Down in (location) Down there Dubbaya when you mean double you Everybody (when referring to the audience) Eye Rack or Eye Ran False pretenses Famed Fatal death Fled on foot Folks Giving 110% Going forward Gunman, especially lone gunman Guys Hunnert when you mean hundred Icon In a surprise move In harm\u2019s way In other news In the wake of (unless it\u2019s a boating story) Incarcerated Informed sources say . . .

He underwent that thing that doctors do when they cut you open and the results were not awesome. The gang-of-one armed homo sapien they think did it \u2013 Lee Harvey Oswald \u2013 tore ass out of the adjacent book depository as men in blue uniforms with responsibility ran after him, giving it somewhere between 109 and 111%. At the moment we have crude pencil doodle details but the innocent-until-proven-guilty murderer is still in close propinquity. According to reliable no-name people with knowledge, the FBI is lending that appendage with an opposable thumb. Mrs. Kennedy, the mammy of all her children is submerged in the dumps as a result of her husband being untimely whacked. You can drain the lizard for two minutes because I won\u2019t be reading any more news until then. -o- Reports from the U.N. in Ee-Ran have Dee-termined U-ranium eff-orts Bee-lieved U-seable are ex-traneous. Meanwhile, fighting has become explosive and by that I mean things have actually gone boom. For retreating Ee-ranian soldiers, their boot heels have been a wandering since they are car and truckless. Many people were in harm\u2019s crosshairs. The corpse count continues to climb but one non-military looky-loo who survived a near-hit said he\u2019s lucky to still be pre-deceased. The end to the bloodshed is possibly definite but for now army guys with fruit salad on their uniforms say bombers will maintain their over fire. Coming up after you flog your bishop Marcie will have weekend weather including details on what could be an ideal storm. -o- Back from a short trip to Phoenix to perform some Dodger duties. Having covered spring training in both Arizona and Florida I greatly prefer the \u201c Valley of the Radio Shack on every corner \u201d. More teams in closer proximity. You can spend your vacation going to ballgames not driving hundreds of miles just to see some split squad game or getting lost in \u201c Deliverance \u201d country. And the fact that it hailed the first day, that could happen anywhere. Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Glendale. The couple in the next room took the word \u201c express \u201d literally. Who says Phoenix has no great theater? A crackling hate-filled performance of \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d played nightly in Room 301. (I sided with her, by the way. He doesn\u2019t spend enough time with the kids.) Hooked up with a few buddies \u2013 Howard from LA and Mike &amp; Bob from New York. Middle-aged Jews don\u2019t hunt. They go to spring training games and eat less sensibly. Which you pretty much have to since Phoenix is the land of bar food. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a place in town that doesn\u2019t serve buffalo wings including sushi bars and vegan cafes. There are also gift shops in every restaurant. This is very strange to me. But you can enjoy a hearty breakfast at the Cracker Barrel and still pick out that perfect wedding gift for sis! We dined our first night at the Saddle Ranch Chop House. What really sold us on the place was the d\u00e9cor. They had a mechanical bull! Add attractive women and beers from many lands and there\u2019s no greater entertainment in the west! \u201cSuburban Cowboy\u201d. For middle-aged Jewish guys this was Hooters without the guilt. The Chop House was just one of many fine establishments in the Westgate City Center. It\u2019s as if a developer said, \u201cYou know what would look good on this empty field in the middle of friggin\u2019 nowhere? Times Square! And just to give it that real authentic desert touch, let\u2019s put a hockey arena in it!\u201d All that was missing was a guy playing Three Card Monty and another urinating on your shoes and you\u2019d think you were back in the greatest city in the world! Warning: There are freeway cameras that capture you speeding. The fine is a hefty $161.00. I\u2019m told the way to fight it is to claim the person in the photo is not you. Not sure that works in Phoenix. It does in Beverly Hills where most women have different faces then they did two months ago. Good ribs at Famous Dave\u2019s. On Wednesday I got to announce the Dodger game from their spring mecca, Camelback Ranch. It was seen on Prime Ticket in southern California and just my luck, nationwide on the MLB network. What a train wreck\u2026 and by that I mean mostly me . First off, I still have an inflamed cornea so I really just have one good eye. I was fine as long as no one hit a ball to left field. I was counting on watching the monitor but because of the glare of the sun I couldn\u2019t see it. They\u2019d be flashing starting line ups on the screen and I\u2019d be merrily talking about something else. Eight years major league experience and viewers must\u2019ve thought I was there because I\u2019d won an auction. Then someone batted out of turn. Well, to be more specific \u2013 three players batted out of turn. This never happens. My daughter, Annie said, \u201cHow could they screw that up? Isn\u2019t baseball like the only thing they do?\u201d So now I\u2019m on coast-to-coast TV completely confused. Then all the substitutions began and it was like Lucy and Ethel at the candy factory and those chocolates just kept coming down the conveyor belt faster and faster. I may have called a Diamondback pinch runner Diablo Cody, I\u2019m not sure. Steve Lyons, my partner, said in fourteen years of broadcasting this was the hardest game he\u2019s ever had to call. It was surely not my finest hour but still I had a blast. Thanks again to Steve for never saying on the air, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? and the Dodgers for the chance. I look forward to doing another game when runners pass each other on the base paths and a meteor lands on the field. If you do come out for spring training make sure you catch a game at Camelback. Tickets are affordable and new this year: free parking. Would you call that a \u201c fee nix \u201d? That\u2019s maybe the only stupid thing I didn\u2019t say during the telecast. \u201c Happy Ho ur\u201d has two meanings in Phoenix. The standard one (that I took advantage of, downing six drinks in rapid succession after the game) and it\u2019s also code for \u201c Early Bird Specials \u201d. The old people who aren\u2019t filed away in Florida are in the Valley of the Sun. And they love their early dinner specials! So if you stop off at a local eatery looking to wet your whistle and order the \u201c Happy Hour \u201d special don\u2019t be surprised if they bring you boiled chicken. But you don\u2019t have to be 80 to feel old. Howard and I asked the young desk clerk at the hotel where might we go for a good breakfast (and decorative soaps) and she said at the Westgate there was the \u201cJimmy Boo-fay \u201d. What she meant of course was Jimmy Buffett\u2019s Margaritaville. Face it, folks; we\u2019re all \u201c wasting away \u201d. During the flight attendant\u2019s safety instructions on my Southwest trip home she warned that there was no smoking in the lavatories and added, \u201cThe fine is $2200. And I\u2019m sure if you were willing to blow that kind of money you would\u2019ve flown Delta.\u201d Later on the flight when they were taking drink orders, the skeesix a row ahead of me actually asked for an Arnold Palmer. I know that\u2019s unbelievable but I saw it with my own one-and-a-half eyes. Now you may think that all I did in Phoenix was eat, drink, and make a jackass of myself on television. Not true. There was so much more! I rented a car, I hosted Dodger Talk, and I got vigorously patted down. What a jealous boyfriend! I was just taking a picture of her on the mechanical bull. I don't know how legit these are but who cares? They're really funny. Every year, English teachers from across the country can submit their collections of actual similes and metaphors found in high school essays. These excerpts are published each year to the amusementof teachers across the country. Here are last year's winners: 1. Her face was a perfect oval, like a circle that had its two sides gently compressed by a thigh Master. 2. His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer without Cling Free. 3. He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it. 4. She grew on him like she was a colony of E.Coli, and he was room-temperature Canadian beef. 5. She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes just before it throws up. 6. Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever. 7. He was as tall as a six-foot, three-inch tree. 8. The revelation that his marriage of 30 years had disintegrated because of his wife's infidelity came as a rude shock, like a surcharge at a formerly surcharge-free ATM machine. 9. The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a bowling ball wouldn't. 10. McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty bag filled with vegetable soup. 11. From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole scene had an eerie,surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and Jeopardy comes on at 7:00 p.m. instead of 7:30. 12. Her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze. 13. The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease. 14. Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed lovers raced across the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains, one having left Cleveland at 6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph, the other fromTopeka at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of 35 mph. 15. They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that resembled Nancy Kerrigan's teeth. 16. John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met. 17. He fell for her like his heart was a mob informant, and she was the East River. 18. Even in his last years, Granddad had a mind like a steel trap, only one that had been left out so long, it had rusted shut. 19. Shots rang out, as shots are known to do. 20. The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil. But unlike Phil, this plan just might work. 21. The young fighter had a hungry look, the kind you get from not eating for awhile. 22. He was as lame as a duck. Not the metaphorical lame duck, either, but a real duck that was actually lame, maybe from stepping on a land mine or something. 23. The ballerina rose gracefully en Pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant. 24. It was an American tradition, like fathers chasing kids around with powertools. 25. He was deeply in love. When she spoke, he thought he heard bells, as if she were a garbage truck backing up. Thanks to toadking.com for the image In 1961 CBS premiered a prime time game show called YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE starring Jackie Gleason. It was not well received. The show next week was unprecedented. Host Jackie Gleason just sat in a chair and... well, you'll have to see for yourself. Jackie Gleason : \"You're in the Picture\" Uploaded by werquin . - Discover more animation and arts videos. Here are more Friday questions answered. From rockfish: Being in both writing and sports, do you know why sports has rarely translated into a successfully popular TV show? TV tends to shy away from sports-themed shows because they can be way expensive. At some point you need to see the games and that requires crowds, a lot of production, and MONEY. There have been some attempts but they tend to be too costly to justify their ratings. The worse ever was a sitcom on CBS adapted from the Jim Bouton book BALL FOUR. They did it as a multi-camera taped show all set in the locker room. You never saw them play. It was insane\u2026 but cheap. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS proves you can make a great sports-themed show. I just wish more people watched it. And there have been others. THE WHITE SHADOW for one. I'm sure you can come up with two or three more. M. Shawn wonders: What exactly is the job of a Television Producer? I know what a Director &amp; Writer does, but I'm ignorant to what a Producer does? Unlike in features this is a hazy area. In features a producer puts together the whole package \u2013 finds or develops the material, champions the project until the studio greenlights it, hires the director, and cast, manages the budget, and in some cases raises the financing. In television the show runner acts as the overseer of the production and in most cases he is a writer. But then there are the non-writing producers (or \u201cpods\u201d). Here\u2019s where it gets real murky. These are generally former network or studio executives who are given sweet production deals. And studios are now forcing writer/producers to attach themselves to these pods because the studio is paying for these pods. So in many cases these \u201cproducers\u201d merely add another level of interference and take part of your profits for the privilege. There\u2019s nothing they do that the writer/producer couldn\u2019t do without them, and has been doing without them very successfully for fifty years. Executive Producer: Tony Soprano. And finally, from YEKIMI: What teacher did you \"love\" the most...someone in grade school? high school? college? or someone in the industry who may have \"taught\" you some things you would have never learned anywhere else? The best teacher I ever had was a high school history teacher named David Solkovits. He made the subject come alive and kindled an interest in history I have to this day. Along the way I have been incredibly fortunate to learn the craft of comedy writing from Larry Gelbart (pictured), James L. Brooks, the Charles Brothers, Tom Patchett &amp; Jay Tarses, Gene Reynolds, and Jerry Belson. My directing gurus were James Burrows and David Lee. There\u2019s not a single English teacher I can point to in high school or college who really made a positive impact. But there was a radio newsman named Bruce Anson who taught me more about writing than anyone else. Here\u2019s the post I once did about him. What are you pondering these days? Last week there was some grumbling that I didn't answer enough Friday questions. So this week I'm devoting two days to your questions. More answered manana. Jeff gets it started. We are big Frasier fans, but we just watch whatever show comes on cable. I never read about Roz - although we like her character a lot. Any stories there? First off, Peri Gilpin is the sweetest human being on the planet. That has nothing to do with the story but I wanted to say it anyway. One day during the first season after a runthrough I said she looked very comfortable behind that control board. She said, \u201cWell, my dad was in radio.\u201d Being an old radio guy myself I asked who he was. She was sure I had never heard of him. He died quite a few years ago. Still, I wanted to know. Jim O\u2019Brien. I was floored. I did know Jim O\u2019Brien. He was program director of KHJ in 1969 and I did an audio documentary for college on the station and spent a day interviewing him. He was a great guy. After KHJ he moved to Philadelphia where in addition to radio he started doing TV weather. He died tragically young in a sky diving accident saving a fellow diver whose chute didn\u2019t open. One day on KHJ he filled in on the air and I happened to tape the show. I dug up the tape \u2013 it was an old musty reel-to-reel, and gave it to Peri the next day. I knew the sound department could figure a way for her to hear it. She was very touched. A couple of days later at runthrough she thanked me again and said it was the first time she had ever actually heard her father on the radio. She was very little when he died. I have other Peri stories but that\u2019s my favorite. Dan Brown asks: What kind of priority was reality in your scripts? How much emphasis was there in keeping things plausible? My biggest pet peeve now with sitcoms is that even some good shows, such as The Office, defy believability. The other night, Dwight punched out Pam's window and tore up the house with a sledgehammer when asked to retrieve an iPod. Uh, sure.) Even in comedy, shouldn't writers ask themselves: Would this really happen? I can\u2019t speak for that OFFICE episode but personally I think it\u2019s crucial to keep it real (Jesus, I sound like Randy Jackson). On MASH we had medical advisers, on-set nurses, and military advisers just to make sure everything was plausible. And on CHEERS we drank. But the best comedy comes from reality. If you can believe or better yet, identify with behavior the better your chances of laughing. Characters can act irrational, crazy, weird \u2013 anything you want, as long as it\u2019s justified. We joke about actors always needing to know their \u201c motivation \u201d but they do. Rachel Roberts, a wonderful actress on the old TONY RANDALL SHOW once said to us after a scene in rehearsal: \u201cSo what\u2019s my motivation? I\u2019m an out patient?\u201d Yo, dawg, keep it real. Know what I'm sayin'? What\u2019s your question? I try to get to as many as I can. Honest. Really. No, I mean it. So let's switch gears from yesterday and baseball. Spanning the dial to bring you the cheesiest in reality shows, I have uncovered a gem . Many thanks to my daughter Annie for turning me onto this little beauty. RU PAUL\u2019S DRAG RACE on Logo. Logo is the gay network although I think this show is even too gay for them . RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE follows your standard reality competition format with contestants put through various challenges and one getting eliminated every week. Except they\u2019re all drag queens and the grand prize is $25,000, a P.R. firm\u2019s services for a year, and various and sundry drag queen gigs. Not exactly life-changing but certainly enough to warrant these guys humiliating themselves on national television. We get to meet the drag queens in and out of costume. And we see Ru Paul not in drag. That was a first for me. Out of the wig and gowns he looks kinda like the villain in PRINCESS AND THE FROG. The contestants all go by their drag queen names. So Pandora\u2019s Box is pitted against the likes of Jujubee, Raven, and Tatiana. They live together in a house with big steel doors and exposed rivets on the wall. I half-expected to see the Gimp from PULP FICTION chained to the floor. Imagine my disappointment. The first challenge was called \u201c the Queen is Right \u201d. It was \u201c the Price is Right \u201d except with items drag queens would consider essentials. So they had to guess the price of white tube socks, pepper spray, duct tape, brass knuckles, and a human hair wig. These items were displayed by muscular male Chippendale-type models who were bare-chested except for neck ties, The winner got to call his mother. I swear, I\u2019m not making this up. Then they all had to play the \u201cSnatch Game \u201d. Gene Rayburn is rolling over in his grave. The queens were expected to impersonate a celebrity of their choice \u2013 complete with costume and make up of course. So they went as Carol Channing, Beyonce, Pink, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Whitney Houston (the Bobby Brown Whitney, not Clive Davis version), and Ru Paul. The 200 pound man who did Carol Channing was a riot and the guy who did Britney looked so authentic he could actually pass for Britney Spears until he got out of a car. They had to answer \u201c Match Game \u201d type questions like \u201c Slutty Sally was so slutty, when she rode on a disco stick she \u2026\u201d Everything about this show just screams class. Then there was a runway competition. One by one these bruisers came out in flamboyant ridiculous gowns, cat suits, and Jackie Kennedy outfits. The bottom two were selected and to help Ru Paul make his final decision they had to \u201cLip Sync For Your Life\u201d. Cat woman stripped down to bra and panties and did cartwheels with such force the stage almost collapsed. He proved to be the loser as Ru Paul delivered the soon to be famous catch-phrase, \u201c Sashay away !\u201d And my favorite moment \u2013 this is what got me hooked \u2013 Ru Paul asks one of the drag queens, \u201cWhere did you get your sense of humor from?\u201d to which he replies, \u201cMy father passed away.\u201d That\u2019s it. I\u2019m setting my DVR for a season pass right now. RU PAUL\u2019S DRAG RACE. For good delicious jaw dropping entertainment you gotta check it out, \u201cSquirrel friends\u201d."}

Every once in a while you come with a goodie. Breaking All The Rules is really underrated. And the world will not be truly postracial until you see a flick like The Seat Filler is in theaters, and The Ugly Truth is straight to DVD. There's a good convo going on below about my post earlier this week on Ben Roethlisberger. I think the take-away, for me, is that this a post that should have stayed in my head, and off the page. We all have our musings, and the kind of conversation we might have over beers with friends. But That's very different than posting something on the Atlantic's website.\n\nFor me the salient facts are as follows: I have no idea what happened, and in such an instance, it's almost never a good idea to start publicly riffing. Rape is a serious accusation, and a kind of crime that presents a specific problem to those who like to bat these kind of things around. I'm not convinced that my contribution to the conversation--absent of any real facts--actually helps anyone, or clarifies anything\n\nLook, I'm a football fan with a particular curiosity about the justice system. This case obviously appeals to my interests. But, on reflection, I don't think I had anything of substance to add. There are limits to living in your own head. Likewise, there are limits your ability to discern between your occasional thoughts and writing with substance. I failed on that count here. \n\nWhile we're in full apology mode, I've been informed by a couple people that \"\"Streisand\"\" is actually an old-school homophobic slur. This highlights the importance of only riffing off jokes that you actually understand. My apologies to all. I would change the post's title. But that feels deceptive.\n\nAnyway, I'm leaving comments off. I think that's enough meta analysis and navel-gazing for one day. Let's not make worse. I think I have some sense of why this whole conversation might be frustrating. Rape has a psychological element that thrives on shame. In our justice system the burden is always on the accuser, but that burden falls especially hard when there are significant disincentives to reporting the crime, and testifying about it. Sexual assault is humiliating, and no one really wants to relive that humiliation. Moreover, I think getting accused of sexual assault twice raises some basic human suspicions. \n\nBut that said, I'm not exactly sure what to do here. I think we all find the presumption of innocence to be essential. With that in mind--What, specifically, should we be saying? How should we be talking about the anonymous accuser? What, specifically, constitutes taking alleged sexual misconduct seriously? Should we really be in the business of denouncing \"\"alleged crimes?\"\" Was the rush to condemn in the Duke Rape Case excusable?\""}

And Greg , our contact from the Rangers camp, e-mailed and said, \"Believe me \u2013 I work every home game and tonight was the loudest applause I have ever heard at the Garden for an anthem. I truly hope we can make this an annual tradition. To top it off, you guys brought us luck during a team slump, as the Rangers got a big win!\" AWESOME!! After their incredible performance of the anthem, all the kids were ushered to 3 VIP suites, where they got to watch the game! While there, they were visited by former Rangers, Gilles Villemure & Pete Stemkowski , who signed autographs and spoke with the kids! Not only that, we ran into America's Next Top Model contestant, April Wilkner , who now works for MSG as a TV correspondent. She was as cool as can be, and a great sport, letting Ethan get in some more celebrity sniffing! During a TV break during the second period of the game, they showed the video filmed by our new friend Faith that we filmed at school the other day of \" Empire State Of Mind ,\" which was spliced with highlights from the season! It was so great hearing the kids and seeing them on the jumbo-tron! The kids all got hot dogs, chips, soda, balloons, and programs courtesy of the Rangers! Thanks to the team, Greg, & Faith, for all their incredible hospitality and for a day the PS22 Chorus will not soon forget! And thanks to Ms. Lisa, Mrs. Johnson, Ms. Laurie, & Ms. Massimo , for capturing the day for us with all the great pics and video footage!! This week, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 is on fire! Starting it off with a viral smash of \"Lisztomania\" by Phoenix , the kids have brought in a whole new bunch of fans from not only the States, but from countries like France, Brazil, Germany,and more! The chorus earned 2 Top 10 YouTube honors for the week and a whole slew of others, while making its homepage the #7 Most Viewed Music Channel this week! (That places it even higher than Beyonce's channel which currently weighs in at #13! Craziness!!) Also this week, the chorus was invited to perform and make its plea for the arts at the District 31 IDEAL parent forum, which you can see in the video at the top of the post. We thank long-time friend of the chorus, Joan McKeever Thomas (see pic below), for this wonderful opportunity to invest in the future of our chorus children's arts education. The kids did us proud as always, and we hope that in sharing both their talent and their story, we made an impact. So how can PS22 top a week like this? Well get ready, because we're going to give it the ol' elementary school try! Indeed there's lots more excitement on the way! On Sunday afternoon, the kids will be appearing at Madison Square Garden , where they will be singing the national anthem at the New York Rangers game! Earlier this week, we got a visit from Greg &amp; Faith representing the team, who shot footage of the kids singing their version of \" Empire State of Mind Pt. XXII \" that will be played at the game alongside highlights of the season. Unfortunately, that video will not be able to be broadcast, but the MSG Network is supposed to be airing the kids' singing of the anthem, though it may be later on in the game during an intermission. Exciting stuff!! Puck drop is at 3:00 PM EST so set those TIVOS &amp; DVRs! Then on Tuesday, prepare for yet another brilliant PS22 Chorus collaboration! The kids will be joining reggae artist Matisyahu on stage at the 92nd Street Y in N.Y.C.!! They'll be performing their version of Matisyahu's \"One Day\" with the man himself! You may recall \"One Day\" was the official song of this year's Winter Olympics, and a great song it is! According to our sources, the show is nearly sold out, and the show will be airing live to 17 different cities in Hillels and JCCs across the country. PS22 will also be hosting a visit from Matis to rehearse (a la our unforgettable Celtic Woman collaboration ), so this should prove to be yet another rewarding week for our blog followers! To follow the PS22 Chorus blog and be alerted to all the new goings-on and music, click here . PS22 Chorus member Fiona wrote this sweet and somber song she ironically calls \" Friendship .\" I found it very touching when she sang it for me, and decided to work with her to arrange it for the full chorus. Here is the beautiful result. Congratulations to Fiona for her superb song and performance here in the video. Already internet fans are comparing her to a young Avril Lavigne ! Love it!! We're so proud of you, Fiona!! What a great example you are to show how to turn painful emotions into something beautiful. UPDATE (3-13-10): CONGRATS TO FIONA!! She earned a YouTube Honor with her original song as the #68 Top Rated Music Video today!! Check out the screencap below! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 made the cover of CHORAL DIRECTOR MAGAZINE ! The magazine includes a very in-depth article/interview with writer Eliahu Sussman , and features some excellent photos from Claudio Papapietro . Unfortunately the on-line version doesn't include all the great photos of the kids that were used in the hard copy version, but the complete article is available on Choral Director Magazine's website . (The magazine was apparently published back in November, but it just came to my attention the other day!) Awesome to discover that PS22 Chorus of 2010 is currently being featured on the home page of Billboard.com on as their featured viral video! Below is a screen cap of their home page, and a cap to the link to the vid and short article praising the kids' new version of \"Lisztomania\" by Phoenix ! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 is definitely causing quite a stir around the internet with its newest cover of \"Lisztomania\" by Phoenix . In addition to earning over 50,000 views on its weekend debut and being featured in top spots on Buzzfeed & Reddit , today the video has shown up on three noteworthy blogs from The Village Voice, Teen Vogue, & MTV Buzzworthy ! All have great things to say about the chorus's latest effort! Check out the screencaps below. And for more on \"Lisztomania,\" click here . The chorus just got another e-mailed message from Lynn Hillary of Celtic Woman , who visited the kids just last week . Dear Gregg and PS22, It's been almost a week since we met you and your incredible bunch of little superstars but we are all STILL talking about it all the time! I can't stress enough what an impression they made on us not just with their glorious voices and obvious love and dedication for the music they sing, but they were just such nice friendly kids!! I just know they will all go on to do great things in the world. Sometimes I forget what joy there is to be found in singing, and you all reminded me of that! Also your advice to the kids about \"if you FEEL the music you can never go wrong!\" is something I will always think about if I ever feel nervous! I've been reading your amazing blog and really wanted to add my thanks too (you don't have to post this up, I'm sure you're running out of space! I just wanted to thank you again, I know it's all been said already but once more wouldn't hurt!!) I was on the meet and greet that night at Radio City and the people were amazed when I told them this was our first time performing with the children, they said it looked so natural, like it was really meant to be a part of the show all the time. If only you could be with us every night! Performing You Raise Me Up now feels strange without PS22, like there is something missing, but their voices always resonate inside my head as we sing, so in a way it feels like they are there all around us, sometimes I imagine that they are! I think this is an experience that will stay with me for a long long time. Thank you so much and please tell them that we really miss them and think about them a lot! I wish you and the children continued success and happiness, and we really hope to see you again soon (for more hugs..and sniffs!) I can't wait to see what you get up to next on your adventures...we'll be watching!! Peace and Love, Lynn"}

Paarthi became too silent, though he never openly acknowledged what happened that day. He still bossed around people but never came anywhere close to us. I left Johnny at my house and asked father to feed him in the afternoon. Every evening, after work, all six of us would walk to my house. We would play with Johnny for about an hour and then the other kids would walk back home.\u00a0There were increasingly frequent occasions when the supervisor would leave the factory in the middle of the day and not return for a long time. We would all gather and start chatting idly about various things. The topics varied everyday \u2013 sometimes it would be about the latest movies, sometimes about movie stars, sometimes about people in the town, sometimes about our future, sometimes about the fantasies that we think of while working. That day Maari was narrating his dreams. \u201cI want to own a car and drive it through our town, honking loud so that every body comes out to watch the procession. Maybe I would also hit the supervisor with it.\u201d \u201cI would want to buy a large house, like with swimming pool and everything.\u201d Naesappan continued the dream. \u201cAnd what? Fill it up with half-naked girls?\u201d Mani asked. He usually did not like such talks. \u201cMaybe I will do that too.\u201d Naesappan replied though he did not seem sure of why anyone would want to fill up a swimming pool with naked girls. \u201cDon't start your lecture now about how dreaming is bad.\u201d Maari said with some apparent irritation. \u201cDreaming is one of the few things we've got here.\u201d Sorna added. \u201cYes. It is the only thing we've got here. But know that your dreams would never happen. Or we'll end up being more disappointed than we are now.\u201d Mani said.  \u201cWhy so? Why can't our dreams happen? We are not going to be in the factory all our lives.\u201d I said.  \u201cMaybe not. But we'd only end up in some other place doing something equally ordinary. Have you ever seen people from our village own cars or houses with swimming pools. Come on. Be practical.\u201d  We all became silent. We all were asking the same question of why such dreams could not happen. It was difficult to digest the fact that we could end up doing such menial work all our lives. Though all of us sensed it, we wanted to still go on believing in the dreams we had. Maari changed the topic before the knot in our throats choked us."}

Georgetown today dethroned the mighty Syracuse Orangemen at Madison Square Garden 91-84, thanks to a epic 27-point performance from junior forward Chris Wright. The #3 ranked Orangemen were also dealt a potentially crucial blow going into March Madness with Arinze Onuaku suffering an injury to his knee. Last night Cincinatti kept their NCAA Tournament dreams alive by upsetting Rick Pitino\u2019s Louisville Cardinals 69-66. Marquette won two tight games against St. John\u2019s and Villanova to advance to semi-finals with the Hoyas. Even the early game was exciting with Seton Hall outlasting Providence in a game where over 200 points were scored. Whoever emerges victorious out of this year\u2019s Big East Tournament will be riding a emotional high going into the Big Dance. The world\u2019s oldest tennis tournament will be played June 21st - July 4th at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club just outside London. The 124th Wimbledon promises to be one of the most highly anticipated sporting events on the planet this summer. The game of tennis is fortunate to have a bevy of international stars playing in the game currently. The world\u2019s will be at their best on the grass courts of the All England, as Wimbledon is often considered the grandest of all the grand slam titles.

It\u2019s just the latest evidence that while mobile advertising as a whole is slowly gaining traction, mobile coupons may be about to take off in a big way.\n\nCompete found that grocery coupons were the most attractive of 10 types of mobile marketing ploys, with 36 percent of U.S. smartphone owners saying there were interested in receiving the discount offers on their handsets. Twenty-nine percent said they wanted to scan barcodes with their phones, while only 15 percent were interested in receiving text message ads.\n\nInterestingly, Compete\u2019s findings come just days after the launch of what may be the nation\u2019s biggest mobile-coupon campaign: Target this week began delivering mobile coupons that can be scanned at the retail counter. Consumers can visit the retailer\u2019s mobile web site or text the word COUPONS to the short code 827438 (TARGET) to opt in and receive a link to a mobile web page containing multiple offers accessible through a single barcode.\n\nMobile coupons have been around for the better part of a decade but have failed to really take off thanks to a lack of widespread retail support and a user experience that is often intolerable. The market is positioned to pick up some serious momentum in the next few years, though, according to a recent report from Juniper Research, which expects it to exceed 300 million people worldwide by 2014. That forecast might look modest if Target\u2019s campaign gets legs and other nationwide retailers follow suit."}

I can read \"tweets\" from my particular area.

It is similar to having a National Capital Region in India. London lies in the South East of England. \n\nCraig: British from Preston, Lancashire (It\u2019s the same county for Manchester). Lancashire is in North West England. The size of this island (including Ireland) is quite small; it ranks 78 on the list of countries sorted by area. The distance between Preston and London is somewhere between 200-300miles. The distance between Agra and Lucknow is 225miles. The reason for giving all these statistics in Craig\u2019s introduction is that Craig very deeply felt that people in the North West are far better than the people in South East. I was amazed at how difference could arise within a matter of couple of 100 miles. A distance which is hardly significant in a country as large as India. \nCraig quite openly expressed how \u2018up in the north\u2019 people think logically where as in the South they are so illogical. \u2018It is so difficult to make them understand\u2019. As an outsider I can never imagine one English man to be less logical than another just because he is from down South. He had been completely stressed out by the London Tube (which can be bewildering for any first timer I must admit) and almost cursed the City. \nThe entire ordeal seemed to be worsened by the fact that it was a sunny day at 19 degrees. He was red and sweating (like a pig?). I was quite suspicious of his several sneezes due to spreading Swine Flu. \nHe must have been in his late thirties and looked like one of the many victims of recession in this country. Though his demeanour was nothing like a victim. He tried to assert himself and tried to make his presence felt by asking for adjusting the air conditioning of all the rooms we were taken to, water and tea. He mentioned how much he had been working on the tests and could solve any problems thanks to his logical thinking. Even between tests he felt necessary to announce how he did so well and that it was so simple if you could just think logically.\nThis could well be an animated effort from the numerous videos on internet telling you to be at ease and confident about yourself at assessment centres. My reaction to him ranged from pity for he had to come to a graduate recruitment to \u2018please shun this attitude\u2019.\n\nImran: I cannot comment on his nationality. Reason being he had come to England as a toddler perhaps from Pakistan. He was also from Manchester, but a different Uni. I had seen him outside the venue sceptical of entering the building. Finally when he did come inside and I tried to give him a smile but he was clearly quite uneasy and started looking in a different direction after a sheepish smile. It took another boy and 10 minutes to finally get him to tell his whereabouts.\nI think his appearance needs to be described here for the sole reason that it was a big part of his personality (and I doubt, his existence). He wore large glasses in an outdated frame. He had longish hair forcibly combed backwards to appear clean. He had a beard which was jet black in colour and went way down his chin. His suit gave away the fact that it was borrowed from a healthy, taller person as he was extremely thin. He was evidently a little withdrawn from other candidates and had been looking for a job for more than a year now. \nI didn\u2019t get to spend much time with him as we were divided into different groups. But as soon we were taken for the first test he folded his trousers up to reveal his mismatched socks and ankles. I do not understand this habit/requirement of Islamic dressing but it did feel a little awkward to do so in a formal environment while wearing a suit. \nImran was a kind of person whom you feel like knowing about because some how he seemed to have held so much behind those glasses and the beard.\n\nChaitanya: Fellow Indian from a remote place at 4 hours distance from London. I am yet to familiarise myself with the naming conventions for places in England. There is a Salford in Manchester, so I am not sure if there could be a different Salfordshire County somewhere in the South. \nI saw him too, outside the venue. He sat under a tree waiting for the time to go in. I believe both of us had arrived a tad too early for British standards (You got to be on time, not a minute before not a minute late). \nI suspect he made an effort to exchange a smile before going in but I escaped behind my red book. Chaitanya is from Hyderabad, AP (I can tell a Hyderabadi from a distance fairly accurately:)). He saw my name on the visitor\u2019s books and started the conversation. He was pleasant to talk to and frankly made me ease out a bit. However during the group activity though he was unexpectedly passive. I deliberately tried to include him in the discussion on 2 occasions which I think he took pretty well. \nAt the end of the day we left the building together asking each other to be in touch. (Just a casual British pleasantry to exchange)\nChaitanya is pursuing an MBA and I was surprised that he applied for this job. \n\n\nDaniel: British from Cambridge. Cambridge is not far from London. But it may take an hour and half with public transport. He reached late and I met him directly in the exam room. This pretty much limited our interaction. \nNothing to do with him, is my excitement of meeting anybody named Daniel. It started well before coming to UK when during one of my numerous therapeutic conversations, S(P) and I decided that I would meet a Daniel here who would be my knight and S(P) would be enchanted by a Sophie :). \nSo with the name Daniel I associate some expectations. And when I do meet some Daniel, I smile to myself remembering our random conversations and the good it does to me \u2013 always :)\nBut this Daniel seemed to be particularly unlike my Daniel. He had a running nose (another suspicion of Swine Flu) and was shivering (out of nervousness?). He had a freckled face and curly red hair. Not a fault of his of course, but somehow I feel that red hair are too doll-like. I blamed him for not being the Daniel and then laughed at my own stupidity. \n\nXang (assumed) and MEA (name not known) were the other 2 candidates. Xang was from Birmingham and hardly spoke.

{"id": "bag-467", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "With all due respect to it, conceptual art isn\u2019t something I'm crazy about and that's why I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Maya Lin's exhibition at the Arts Club of Chicago, on view until April 23, 2010. Lin, an American artist and architect who explores landscape and geological phenomena, creates uncanny replicas of commonly known locations, such as Blue Lake Pass, wooden rock-like formations that recreate the Rocky Mountain pass. Although her art seems cool and impersonal upon first glance, once you spend a bit of time with it you can't help but be awed by her work.\n\nLin was awarded a doctorate from Yale and is best known for the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington, D.C, which she designed in 1982 while an undergraduate at Yale.\n\nThe work in the exhibition is a continuation of the artist's previous exhibitions. Lin's 1998 Topologies and the 2006-2009 Systematic Landscapes continue here.\n\nWhen you think about the vantage point Lin is trying to express, the way computers and scientists view the landscape as circles and squares on satellite grid, the beauty she's imparting has a distinct purpose: to remind us of the importance of nature in our lives.\n\nThe interesting thing about Lin's work is that it seems hard and distant on the outside, but when you study it and reach and understanding about it, you warm up to it and become moved by it, to the point of wanting to escape the city to the nearest woods. This hard-shelled, but soft interior is the nature of Lin's art, and is a profound statement about the natural world. In order to become one with it you have to take careful note of it."}

Man on the Raw and I first went raw on February 16, 2004, it was a Valentine Day\u2019s gift to ourselves. We went to Barnes and Noble in Aurora, Colorado and were determined to find an eating program we could do together. The first two raw books we bought were David Wolfe\u2019s \u201cNature\u2019s First Law: The Raw Food Diet\u201d and \u201cThe Complete Book of Raw Food.\u201d I have been blessed to begin my raw food adventure with my husband. No matter how far one or both of us may stray off the raw path, we both know the importance of getting back on track and finding some sort of balance in our lives. I realize that we may be the exception and not the rule. Many people who embrace raw foods do so&nbsp;alone, and in the beginning, it can be a very isolating experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends and family don\u2019t understand the weird new \u201cdiet\u201d you are on and can\u2019t seem to understand why a slab of cow is bad for your health. It can be hard going it alone. Thank heavens for Raw Food online communities. I have been exploring raw foods for six years and even now I embrace community. I am a member at Give it to Me Raw, Global Juice Feast, Juicefeasting.com, Daily Raw Inspiration and most recently Raw Food Rehab. I observe for the most part, reading the forums, sharing my photos and commenting whenever a topic moves me and I can add something constructive to the conversation. Raw communities are a wonderful place to share your raw triumphs, tribulations and everything in between. I encourage you, if you haven\u2019t already, join community. I am a huge fan of author and owner of RAWvolution and Euphoria Loves Rawvolution , Matt Amsden. On Tuesday he will share his \u201c10 Thoughts\u201d and Wednesday his recipes, from the Complete Book of Raw Food Endeavor , make an appearance.

Sunchokes, also called Jerusalem artichokes ((They\u2019re not from Jerusalem, and they\u2019re not artichokes.), are the roots of a plant in the sunflower family. Sunchokes look like bulging ginger roots with many stubby outcroppings. The ivory flesh has the consistency of water chestnuts and taste slightly sweet and nutty. Select - Look for firm sun chokes that are evenly beige. They are available all year-round. Store - Refrigerate in a plastic bag for up to 1 week. Once exposed to the air, sunchokes oxidize quickly and discolor.&nbsp; You can soak them in lemon&nbsp;water&nbsp;to avoid discoloration. Preparation - Scrub sunchokes and don't peel them, all the are just below the surface of the skin. These are the sunchokes we pulled out of our garden a week ago. They were planted about 3 years ago, each year we remember we have a crop and we start digging. No need to re-plant every year because there is always a few surviving in the ground and they do a good job at taking root. They are a bit like weeds in that sense. Use Sunchokes as you would jicama, in salads, soups, mashed, dehydrated, the list goes on and one.

This past week was a frenzy of dehydrated treats. It started simple enough. Jonathan Weber\u2019s Spicy seed mix (p. 117) transformed from thick, soggy glob to a very crunchy, seasoned snack, in a relatively short amount of time. The spices&nbsp;were on point, Man on the Raw thought the nibbles was just spicy enough without overpowering the taste buds. Beware of&nbsp;John Larsen's&nbsp;Tasty Sea snacks (p. 117). I found a half of cup of Nama Shoyu&nbsp;a bit too generous, causing it to be to salty. Although, Man on the Raw enjoyed the flavor, he suggested I tone&nbsp; down the Nama Shoyu, if I were going to take a batch to an Oscar party I was attending.&nbsp; On a second batch, I decreased&nbsp;the amount of Nama Shoyu to one-fourth of a cup, made them bite-size&nbsp;and was off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha, ha happy ending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the point where happy endings&nbsp;turn sour and my mild obsessive tendencies came to surface. The story actually begins on February 19th, when I came across some incredible Raw Zucchini Chips featured on the blog Green and Crunchy . They were beautiful, crispy, crunchy little discs. By far a perfect substitution for Lays or Pringles any day. Life moved forward, as it does so often, and I quickly forgot about the little bits of heaven, at least until I saw Bitt of Raw\u2019s posting of Zucchini Chips and her cute dog eating raw zucchini. Adorable. Zucchini chips were not going away any time soon, thus the seeds of my obsession was firmly planted in my brain. I went to The Complete Book of Raw Food, you know my endeavor and all, searching for a recipe comparable to what I had read on the blogs. I found what I was seeking on page 178, Shazzie \u2019s recipe for Curly Crisps. On the surface, everything seemed to be moving in the right direction. I had a cool hand-held mandoline, a few small zucchini, a beet and a couple of plump, light green, stubby things called Mexican Squash. Using my cool, hand-held mandoline, I sliced the vegetables into thin rounds, a shy away from being paper thin, but not quite. I choose a variety of basic seasonings, including garlic, onion, wasabi and barbecue powders, nothing too spectacular or out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Well maybe the wasabi, but&nbsp;I digress. My first batch, I placed in the dehydrator for 115 degrees for about 12 hours. The edges of my produce curled, taking on a slight crispiness, but nothing compared to potato chips. The middle of the vegetable discs were something less to be desired. They were soft and pliable, resembling nothing like a chip. I popped them back in the dehydrator for another few hours. Nothing changed, except the size of my zucchini chips, they shrank. This whole process continued over the course of a week. Attempting varying sizes and thinness of different root vegetables, with Teflex sheet, without Teflex sheet, with salt, without salt, with oil, without oil. Good, eatable food was thrown in the compost bucket because they weren't crisp enough. I was relentless, Man on the Raw was impatient with my compulsive, slightly psychotic behavior. But I couldn\u2019t help it. I wanted a crispy, crunchy chip and I was bound and determined to create one. Finally, I received a reprieve. I had a promising batch of zucchini and beet chips on Sunday. They came from the dehydrator after 30 hours at 115 degrees and they were actually a good, crunchy consistency.&nbsp; Success, the girls enjoyed them and I finally had something the Man on the Raw could give his seal of approval on and he wouldn\u2019t have to send me away to a psych ward. That was the case, until the girls ate most of them and the ones that remained were left uncovered and I suppose the moisture from the Colorado air (yeah, right), turned them back to a soft, pliable chip taking on the texture of a mildly waterlogged potato chip. Of course, when Man on the Raw came home after an exhausting evening of work, he wasn\u2019t in the correct frame of mind to believe me when I told him my chips were&nbsp;crispy at one point in their life. He just kind of heaved a sigh and his chin sank to the ground. I bite down on the side of my lip and&nbsp;quickly promised I wouldn\u2019t attempt another batch of vegetable chips until I ended my juice feast and I was able to taste test&nbsp;them myself.

A little over a week ago I was laying in bed, sick as a dog, unable to answer emails, talk to anyone, have any sort of conversation... it sucked. But at least I'm not sleeping because I've been running all over town, taking advantage of a gorgeous Friday -- and one of the last of the Summer.\n\nOne of my favorite things in life are animals. Not only are they delicious, but they're adorable as well. I try to make it to the Central Park Zoo at least once a year, if I can, to just walk around and check out what they've got. It's not much, but it satiates my appetite enough to make me feel somewhat OK with the fact that I haven't been to the Bronx Zoo in about 18 years. I went through a phase where I hated zoos and found them to be evil and cruel for taking animals out of their habitat and plucking them down in the middle of a pen for everyone to see -- but my opinion has since changed. The wild is dangerous with poachers, over expansion, and pollution. At least in these pens, these animals are somewhat safe. My biggest concern is their boredom, as I'm sure looking at people all day is not as exciting for them as it is for me. If anyone has any opinion on the subject of animals in Zoos, I'm open to hear and potentially learn, from your opinion.\n\nAnyways... photos from yesterday:\n\nMy boyfriend and I at the Zoo:\n\nHere are the penguins. My boyfriend says I walk like a penguin and he's not entirely wrong:\nAfter the zoo we went to the BMW dealership to check out some bikes and then had an amazing Indian food dinner at this spot called Indigo Bistro in midtown east. I think it's going to be our new regular spot since the service was AMAZING and the food was delicious. They brought us free vegetable fritters, me a free mango lassi, and made a special dish for my boyfriend who couldn't decide what he should get! Happy Indian indepedance Day, by the way!\n\nApres dinner I hopped over to Art Bar to meet up with my friend John Dirschel for his birthday and was delighted to see his twin brother Brian as well! In high school I was soooo in love with John Dirschel, as were all my friends. He was so cute and looked like Kurt Cobain with long blonde hair and blue eyes. I was a tomboyish runt in high school and everyone just saw me as one of the boys. I had mostly guy friends who considered me their best friend/little sister, and John was one of those guys. I was his lil' sis that he'd wrestle and mess around with... and meanwhile I would dream of a day that he would see me as more than a friend and ask me out. But he was 2 years older than me and left for college when I was a sophomore and soon he joined the Coast Guard, cut of all his hair, and toured the world. I remember seeing him in 2006 when he was on break and he was jacked up. I couldn't believe my scrawny Kurt-esque high school crush was now a real-life man.\n\nHe's since left the Coast Guard (or leave of absences? whatever it's called when you don't have to go on tour anymore) and getting his Masters degree in LA and is now way smaller but super toned from doing exercizes that make him secretly strong. When he lifts me up in the air, I basically float. It's so wonderful to be able to see him from time to time and catch up on our lives. We live such different lives but are still insanely connected with many of the same intersts. Anyway, it was really great seeing him this time around since the last time I was with him was when Brandon called me to tell me that our friend Vinny had passed. John was a wonderful shoulder to cry on at that moment, but for whatever reason, it left me nervous to see him again.\n\nHere's a photo of me with the Dirschel boys. Brian is on the left and John is on the right. They're identical and two of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet in your life:\nAt about 2 or 3 am we left Art Bar and went to Electric Lady Land studios to visit Courtney Love who is there recording. Hole's songs are turning out amazing and really right up there in the realm of Live Through This (my favorite Hole album... according to my boyfriend it's because I was an angry teenager when it came out, and it's a tortured and angry record) and Celebrity Skin. They were recording a cover song -- I can't say which one just yet cos it might be a secret -- and the boys and I were there to be a peanut gallery and talk about quantum physics. I saw a ghost recently and Micko Larkin, the Hole guitarist, heard one sing into the mic at the studio lastnight... so we exchanged real-life ghost stories. I don't think I've gone crazy, but there's a jury out on that.\n\nAnyway, the bathroom at Electric Lady Land is super cool, so Courtney and I took pics of each other. I think this will be my album artwork one day in my fantasy life:\n\n\nAnd here's Courtney:\nAt about 5:30am, Brian and I called it a night and he came over to mine to crash and provided a wonderful dose of entertainment in the morning as Gurj was packing to move out of the legendary 3A apartment.\n\nIt's the end of another era."}

The skies didn't turn black, there was no roaring wind or crashing seas, no pouring rain or anything else. In fact, all there was to hear was the occasional flogging of my sails as the little bit of wind I did have faltered in and out.\n\nEvery big event that has taken place during my trip seems to be maddeningly calm and slow. When I left Marina del Rey, there was barely enough wind to keep my sails full, I almost crossed the equator twice in one day because there was no wind and a current pushing me backwards and now I have a good day with lots of wind but I get into the \"Roaring\" 40s and my wind dies. Next thing you know I'll be down at Cape Horn up on deck in a swimming suit reading a book!\n\nAs frustrating as it is, I guess I am really lucky to have such calm weather so far, even if it doesn't make for many exciting stories. The wind is beginning to pick up so hopefully I'll be able to make up for the slow day.\n\nMy chart desk seat is much more stable. Whether thats due to the Velcro thats all over the bottom now or just because of it being calmer out I have yet to find out.

{"id": "bag-602", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "I thought it would be appropriate to share with you an excerpt from my book, Safe At Home, about playoff baseball. So enjoy! And Go Blue! What I've learned about the playoffs and the Word Series is to be very, very excited. But not too excited. It's not that I don't appreciate the postseason. I do. And it's not that I don't recognize the majesty of St. Louis Cardinal Jack Clark taking Tom Niedenfuer deep in Game 6 of the 1985 National League Championship Series. And it's not that I don't long to see the Dodgers win a World Series again. But the truth is, part of who wins that classic matchup is based on the same factors as who wins a regular-season game -- skill, smart managing, the ability to bounce back, and luck. That's what makes the game great. Still the notion that postseason games are somehow more important, or more pressure-packed, or more, I don't know, special than a contest in the middle of May, or July, or even April, obscures a larger truth, which is this: Every game is special, and it's how a player performs in each game, and in every game, that determines his success, not how he plays in one series. For years, I had pretty limited postseason experience (quite limited actually), but like so many fans before me, I learned the risks of postseason exuberance the hard way in the fall of 2008. I found myself an adult in a whole new baseball situation as I watched my Dodgers win a postseason series and move on to the NLCS. We hadn't won a postseason series since 1988, when I was just fifteen, but I had always appreciated postseason ball. It was fun to watch the games of the fall even if my heart wasn't emotionally invested in the teams that were playing. I could really just sit back and appreciate the fundamentals at their best. Last fall proved different. I wasn't just invested in who won, I was all in. I sat in my seat with a white-knuckled, sweaty-palmed death grip on whatever I was holding at the time. Every pitch meant something. Every out. Every managerial move. Every call by the ump. The fans were alive. They stood when there were two outs and two strikes, waving those rally towels as if they possessed magical powers to make the batter strike out. \"Throw him the chair!\" my brother screamed. Translation: \"Sit him down.\" As you might expect, losing to the Phillies in the NLCS last year was devastating. My brother and I were inconsolable. As lame as it might sound, a little piece of my heart broke that night. An even bigger piece of my brother's heart broke that night. The game that we were eliminated in was at Dodger Stadium, and we stayed for about an hour after the last out. In that hour, players came out for curtain calls and blew kisses to the fans that were still there. I would say over a thousand fans stayed, and we were a rowdy bunch. Frank McCourt and his lovely wife stuck around. A chant started. \"Please sign Manny.\" Clap, clap. Clap, clap, clap. \"Please sign Manny,\" the Dodgers fans shouted. Nomar came out of the dugout, and the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. He waved and put his hand over his heart paying tribute to us fans. He took a long look around, soaking up the moment, his moment. It seemed like he was saying good-bye to the stadium; I hoped he wasn't saying good-bye to baseball. Tommy Lasorda said a few words into a microphone. He thanked \"the best fans in baseball.\" He finished up his speech by saying, \"When you lay your head down on the pillow tonight, say a prayer for Tommy and the Dodgers.\" It was a vivid moment, and while we reached a disappointing end, there was something strangely uplifting about the whole scene. As we were walking to the car, I saw daddies holding sleepy kids with their baseball gloves still on, draped over their father's backs. I found solace in the idea that even though we weren't moving on to the World Series, memories were made that night. The children of the fans from '88 had their own stories to tell. A whole new generation of Dodger fans got to experience NLCS baseball for the first time. And who knows, maybe one of these years we'll actually win. PEACE, LOVE, AND BASEBALL, Alyssa"}

Of course, they can mean three things about you: either you are super-bogged by too many features and want to keep it simple, or you do not want to move on to newer technology no-matter-what, or just that you can\u2019t afford a high-end phone. Be wary of these judgments and make sure you know your slot.  :) The latest on the menu \u2013 iPhones, Nexus Ones, HTCs and Blackberries of the world. Hmmm. I am not a fan of these phones. Mainly because the features are so many and so distracting that you don\u2019t feel like doing simple things -  like checking your email on your laptop and replying at your own snail-ish and convenient pace, after  giving a thought about how and what to write. I remember, in my primary school, we were taught by our IT teacher that the main advantage of an email is: \u201cAn email service doesn\u2019t have the dangling urgency of a telephone call\u201d. So why change the way nature (err\u2026 ) used to work, and get hooked to replying to emails at lightning speed? Why obliviate all those expensive MP3 players, IPods, Cameras and Laptops that you invested in? Use them too fellas! Don\u2019t give it all to your mobile communicating device."}

I now feel as though I'm making some progress. I mentioned previously that I had been medically retired from my job and, at the age of 53, that wasn't really in my plans. Aside from anything else, I've always been a very busy person and I felt as though my days didn't have much of a purpose. I had lunch with my former work colleagues last week and that was my 'leaving do'. It was lovely to see them and they gave me gifts and cards with lots of lovely messages (which made me cry!) but then it finally felt as though that chapter of my life had closed and that I can move on. So, I have applied to the local CAB to do some voluntary work and things have moved really quickly - I have an interview there on Wednesday so fingers crossed! I have also re- started learning Spanish - I began last summer but got distracted and now I'm trying to make up for lost time. it's great because I really feel as though I'm making progress this time around. I am also wanting to take up a new hobby. I used to do lots of cross-stitch but my hands won't allow me to do that any more so I am thinking of trying crochet which is not such fine work. So, we'll see how that goes. All in all I feel much more positive about things."}

I had blood work done last week while getting a second x-ray on my tailbone, and today the results came back normal. Good news on top of the fact that my tailbone seems to be healing according to the    x-ray. When I asked the doctor if it would be okay to travel again with this... this... broken butt? Isn't that what it is, really? I broke my butt. There's no getting around this. Not with Leta walking around going, \"When is mom's butt going to get better?\" WHEN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT IT OUT LOUD. IN THE HALLWAY. AT SCHOOL. The doctor said to take my butt pillow with me, and I'd be fine. Also, just curious, she was. What did I do for a living since I travel this much? Now, picture this, okay. She has just inspected me, taken a look at The Smallest Butt In The History Of The Universe, and this conversation is inevitably going to result in, \"Oh, my friend told me about you. You're that woman?\" So before I told her, I said, um, the size of my  butt falls under doctor/patient privilege, right? The Hippocratic Oath? And she was all, I will take knowledge of your tiny butt TO THE GRAVE. Thank God no one will know about it now. Anyway, I had to make an emergency appointment with my dentist this morning because one of the teeth on the right side of my mouth is making it so that I cannot chew food: the shooting, lightening-patterned pain! Straight up through my jaw, up into my eye, and bang into my forehead. And when my dentist sat down and asked what was going on, I was all, I'M FALLING APART! You think I'm kidding, but the odds are that you'll lean over to take a look inside my mouth and suddenly my head will topple off right into your lap! An x-ray and twenty minutes of prodding and hammering away proved that it has to be a sinus infection. It's just that a certain nerve in a certain tooth sits inside my sinus cavity. Are you serious? It has nothing to do with my bones? I was prepared for surgery, and you're giving me a prescription for an antibiotic? How can I possibly write about this in all caps, SIR?! I can't go back to the people with a sinus infection! They want DISEASE! They want LIFE-EXPECTANCY! Can I at least tell them you prescribed a cane? Because, let's be honest. I have an image to uphold. So far, so good I've recently made friends with a lovely woman up the street who kindly took pity on me when she noticed that I spend my entire day with my husband. Not that Jon is difficult to live or work with. He is my soul mate and best friend."}

I often found myself anticipating the beginning of such a beautiful show, free of cost.   At night the sky was more often then not clear, the moon strong and bright(really there was very little need for night lights, street lights, or security lights,) the sky full of life, with thousands of stars to gaze upon, too many to count, and many a falling star was searched for.\n\n\nI remember a rich childhood full of many blessings!"}
{"id": "bag-63", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "Let's Talk About Food And Health\nDavid Jesse's recent article at annarbor.com about a Mitchell Elementary School program to provide weekend \"food backpacks,\" made me think it is time to say something more about food, and health. \nDifferent schools and school districts have different feelings about how much they should help provide a safety net for students. Some schools have stepped up to the plate--for instance, Bryant/Pattengill in Ann Arbor runs a clothes closet, and the Ypsilanti Public Schools run one for the whole district. Other schools have been reluctant to jump into providing services, because the need is so great, and they don't want to be seen as a giant social service agency.\n\nOn the other hand--kids who are hungry, cold, or sick don't do very well in school. I think that those schools that try to support students' other needs are doing the right things. But remember, knowledge is power, and a lot of people who are eligible for programs don't know they are eligible. So here are a few resources. Please share them!\n\n1. Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program (which includes breakfast): you can register for this at any time during the school year. If, for instance, you had work at the beginning of the year and wouldn't qualify, you might find that you qualify now. Ask for an application at the front office of the school your child attends. Some schools use this as a way to identify kids who qualify for other benefits/scholarships. (I've written about school lunch here.)\n\n2. The Food Stamp application is now online. This is new, and it is great news. Spread the word. A lot of people are surprised to find out that they qualify. If you want an estimate as to whether your family will qualify, here is the link to a food stamp calculator. And here is the link to the application. \n\n3. Similarly, you can now enroll your kids in the MIChild/Healthy Kids program with an online application. (Women 19-44 can be enrolled in the Plan First family planning program through the same application.)\n\n4. The Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools has clinics in several local schools, including schools in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Willow Run. Check them out here.\n\n5. Pregnant women and kids up to age 5 can be served by WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)--and that can help stretch the overall food budget. WIC also has some satellite clinics, which is helpful for people living on the edges of the county."}
{"id": "bag-226", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "on't, let this be a lesson to you! Hair Removal... (I don't have a clue as to who wrote this, but.....WHAT A RIOT!) All hair removal methods have tricked women with their promises of easy, painless removal - The Epilady, scissors, razors, Nair and now...the wax. Read on......... My night began as any other normal weeknight. Come home, fix dinner, play with the kids. I then had the thought that would ring painfully in my mind for the next few hours: 'Maybe I should pull the waxing kit out of the medicine cabinet.' So I headed to the site of my demise: the bathroom. It was one of those 'cold wax' kits. No melting a clump of hot wax, you just rub the strips together in your hand, they get warm and you peel them apart and press them to your (or wherever else) and you pull the hair right off. No muss, no fuss. How hard can it be? I mean, I'm not a genius, but I am mechanically inclined enough to figure this out. (YA THINK!?!) So I pull one of the thin strips out. Its two strips facing each other stuck together. Instead of rubbing them together, my genius kicks in so I get out the hair dryer and heat it to 1000 degrees. ('Cold wax,' yeah...right!) I lay the strip across my thigh. Hold the skin around it tight and pull. It works! OK, so it wasn't the best feeling, but it wasn't too bad. I can do this! Hair removal no longer eludes me! I am She-rah, fighter of all wayward body hair and maker of smooth skin extraordinaire. With my next wax strip I move north. After checking on the kids, I sneak back into the bathroom, for the ultimate hair fighting championship. I drop my panties and place one foot on the toilet. Using the same procedure, I apply the wax strip across the right side of my bikini line, covering the right half of my hoo-ha and stretching down to the inside of my butt cheek (it *was* a long strip) I inhale deeply and brace myself....RRRRIIIPPP!!!! I'm blind!!! Blinded from pain!!!!....OH MY GAWD!!!!!!!!! Vision returning, I notice that I've only managed to pull off half the strip. CRAP! Another deep breath and RIPP! Everything is spinning and spotted. I think I may pass out...must stay conscious...must stay conscious. Do I hear crashing drums??? Breathe, breathe...OK, back to normal. I want to see my trophy - a wax covered strip, the one that has caused me so much pain, with my hairy pelt sticking to it. I want to revel in the glory that is my triumph over body hair. I hold up the strip. There's no hair on it. Where is the hair??? WHERE IS THE WAX??? Slowly I ease my head down, foot still perched on the toilet. I see the hair. The hair that should be on the strip...it's not! I touch. I am touching wax. I run my fingers over the most sensitive part of my body, which is now covered in cold wax and matted hair. Then I make the next BIG mistake...remember my foot is still propped upon the toilet? I know I need to do something. So I put my foot down. Sealed shut! My butt is sealed shut. Sealed shut! I penguin walk around the bathroom trying to figure out what to do and think to myself 'Please don't let me get the urge to poop. My head may pop off!' What can I do to melt the wax? Hot water!! Hot water melts wax!! I'll run the hottest water I can stand into the bathtub, get in, immerse the wax-covered bits and the wax should melt and I can gently wipe it off, right??? *WRONG!!!!!!!* I get in the tub - the water is slightly hotter than that used to torture prisoners of war or sterilize surgical equipment - I sit. Now, the only thing worse than having your nether regions glued together, is having them glued together and then glued to the bottom of the tub...in scalding hot water. Which, by the way, doesn't melt cold wax.So, now I'm stuck to the bottom of the tub as though I had cemented myself to the porcelain!! God bless the man who had convinced me a few months ago to have a phone put in the bathroom!!!!! I call my friend, thinking surely she has waxed before and has some secret of how to get me undone. It's a very good conversation starter 'So, my butt and hoo-ha are glued together to the bottom of the tub!' There is a slight pause. She doesn't know any secret tricks for removal but she does try to hide her laughter from me. She wants to know exactly where the wax is located, 'Are we talking cheeks or hole or hoo-ha?' She's laughing out loud by now...I can hear her. I give her the rundown and she suggests I call the number on the side of the box. YEAH!!!!! Right!! I should be the joke of someone else's night. While we go through various solutions. I resort to trying to scrape the wax off with a razor. Nothing feels better than to have your girlie goodies covered in hot wax, glued shut, stuck to the tub in super hot water and then dry-shaving the sticky wax off!! By now the brain is not working, dignity has taken a major hike and I'm pretty sure I'm going to need Post-Traumatic Stress counseling for this event. My friend is still talking with me when I finally see my saving grace....the lotion they give you to remove the excess wax. What do I really have to lose at this point? I rub some on and OH MY GOD!!!!!!! The scream probably woke the kids and scared the dickens out of my friend. It's sooo painful, but I really don't care. 'IT WORKS!! It works!!' I get a hearty congratulation from my friend and she hangs up. I successfully remove the remainder of the wax and then notice to my grief and despair....THE HAIR IS STILL THERE.......ALL OF IT! So I recklessly shave it off. Heck, I'm numb by now. Nothing hurts. I could have amputated my own leg at this point."}

Part 2 was Charity for charity's sake & covered tons of opportunities we have to give back to our community without busting out our check books. So what's the topic of discussion today you ask? \n\nMaking the world a lovelier place by any means necessary! Ready to get your hands dirty? Literally?Let me start off by admitting something... I have black thumbs. BUT this is something that I don't like about myself - that I CAN CHANGE! Do you have black thumbs too? Do things go from garden to graveyard in the blink of an eye? Lets make this change and grow together - pun intended! We all know that reading is the best way to learn about anything and I have to say that You Grow Girl by Gayla Trail has really opened my eyes as to where I've gone wrong in the past with my garden patches. You'll learn all about starting from seed, composting, irrigation, container gardens & more! She also has a new book that just came out - Grow Great Grub. I don't have a copy yet but you can bet your pretty pink garden shears that I'll be picking one up soon and you should too. If you are broke but ready to get growing check out her blog. \nFun Fact: The National Gardening Association says that on average families can get up to a $500 return on their investment in gardening. For $500 me & my manfriend can spend a long weekend at the beach! Gardening here I come! \n\nSo, maybe you want to see things spring up and grow.. but you don't have any dirt to dig in? Think again! Dirt is everywhere. Sure it may not belong to you but that doesn't mean it's off limits. Grow rogue! Look around your neighborhood. There are medians, patches of grass next to bus stops, unused space in local parks AND yes - vacant lots that are screaming for a little love & affection. There's plenty of fun and sneaky ways to spread that love. Get Fresh Cut put together this rad video that will teach you all about DIY seed bombing and inspire you to transform your neighborhood! \n*I will say that you may not want to plant veggies and herbs for consumption in these public places.

Okay - on with the show:\n\n\nDid that get you all riled up and ready for more guerrilla style beautification tactics? Yes? Fantastic! Let's talk graffiti! No, don't bust out the Krylon just yet.. You will need a beer & a blender though for this most amazing and gorgeously green way to decorate your hood. Mossgraffiti! Okay, this won't work perfectly in all climates - including my own. Not a lot of moss here in Austin, TX... but that doesn't mean I won't give it a shot. You can create any image you like with moss and adhere it to any surface.

Of course I drank all the chocolate milk. School lunch at my school/workplace always comes in these strange little packages. I have to say that it is very hard to open them.

The photo can be anything related to school lunch. You might be a teacher who wants to take a photo of the lunch at your school. You might be a nutritionist who wants to highlight some really great lunches. You might be a lunch lady who wants to share some terrific (or not so terrific) meals. What are you (students, kids, teachers) eating for school lunch? Or even what great lunches have you packed for your child? I need you to know that I will be monitoring the content aggressively. The group rules include: Post only your own pictures (taken by you). Please obtain parental permission to post pictures of students' faces. If you must post pictures of students' without parental permission (as in a large group photo), please blackout their faces. Might as well get adults' permission to post their faces on the photo group. For example, you can take a picture of your own child with a lunch, because you are that child's parent. For this reason I haven't taken pictures of the cafeteria or the lunch line because I do not have parental permission to shoot the kids. You also must have a Yahoo ID to access Flickr (it's a part of Yahoo). And if you want to enjoy the photos and comment, you do need to log in with your Yahoo ID. A picture is worth a thousand words.

He seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. It is all for the better. He was warm and cared for. I found a wounded bunny near a hay pile I was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. He had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when I was near by. His hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. He's alive, but I've had my Dr. Quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn't fare well with human interference even when well intended. I imagine a cat got him. I iodined it after saline bath. He is more alert than when I found him, and I have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. Not sure if he will make it. He'll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. He is calm when held. The wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. These little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. Life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. The conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. Lilly had her lambs last night. She finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. This early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. The male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn't happen for a few days or more.] The girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. Sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - I treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. Lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. She's a big girl who throws strong lambs. I was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. I tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of Lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but I guess Mlle. Nature just wasn't ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. Normally I wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it's sunny and warm, and Lilly is an old pro. It's less stressful than being separated from the flock. They develop so much faster - I find - when they can go outside. I want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- I have to say, I feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. The trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and Martyn, and it showed this season. We lost the stillborn girl, and I still fret about the surviving twin's rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. And relieved. As the last ewe to lamb, Lilly rests, and waits. And one of Audrey's boys catches some sunny zzzzz's. On what most likely was a chilly March 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at St. Mary's in Rochester, Minnesota, I came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 PM. And so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how I almost killed my mother on my birthday. Perhaps it is one reason I chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. In all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and I have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. Supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because I was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like JFK - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother's looks to JFK. I was compared to a lobster. And hours before I barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. Her untimely death led me to receive her name, Katherine, instead of Bridgette which my mother had picked out. I cant imagine being named Bridgette, although as a child I liked to tell this story, since Bridgette Bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, I thought BB was quite the cat's pajamas. So I can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold March night for my father. I wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. Did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? As I get older, 52 years older to be exact, I can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. But being true Minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. In time, my tastes changed to German chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. I still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. While I appreciate that I was born, I am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. In fact, I couldn't disagree more. It's an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. Miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. I get just about as much birth as I need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. I think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. It's a mess. In fact, it makes no sense. A creature pushed out of a keyhole - that's not beautiful, it's bizarre. It's a miracle, but it's not beautiful. But it's the only way to get a foot in the door, isn't it? Staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. But there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to Neil Young. No puppies. No showers on a hot day. No hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. No matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. That some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. The winds have come in, it's bone chilling. All day I was carried back to a place I liked to hide when I was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. Alone, I felt protected, but spooked at the same time. Rushing back to the house, I'd hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the Wizard of Oz. But home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. It wasn't messy. It's like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but I feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. Together with my flock, I experienced the trauma of last year's lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, I carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if I bump it just right. I realized it's my very own birth story, and it's required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. March 10, Post Note: Daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. They've made it 8 hours...we'll hope they do well tonight. They appear okay. I saw some tail wiggling while at the udder [ asign they are getting milk]. When I saw these pictures, I was quite amused at their expressions. Amazing how they adapt. We are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. These are Fern's lambs, now one week old. We had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. I knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but I like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. The new mothers can surprise you though - I once had a new mom waddling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. So last night I was pretty sure Nelly Moser would lamb. And she did. I have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother Nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. Arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. But she wasn't caring to them very proficiently- she wasn't licking them or chortling much. One was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. I checked her udder and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign.

I decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. Nelly was just a bit clueless, but she's adapting. She is chortling more, and can get them to the udder, but she's not as good as the pros at helping them 'get it\". She did not dry them off well either, and I had to step in and help. Within a half hour, I had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. We will just have to watch them and see.

I look at photos of other babies the same age and he just seems older.

Bert is officially in size 3 diapers. I don't know if it is because he is a big boy (appointment next week) or just because he is a big-time blower-out of diapers. Jeff turned 33! We spread his birthday celebration from morning 'til night and I have a special adventure planned on Saturday. As well, we have a birthday dinner with his family on Sunday.

That is a typical day for me. Meanwhile, I get text messages from Bill that say we're on scrolling on the top of the homepage of MTVmusic.com (wrong picture too....sucks to be Packy and Chad) or emails from our manager, J.J., about crazy stuff that I'm not at liberty to speak of. It is all completely surreal. I read all of this usually while I'm at work, put my phone back in my apron (DON'T TELL MY MANAGER PLEASE) and then run a fish and chips and club sandwich to table 32.

I think people would have been appalled, disgusted, and outraged if someone the size of Calista Flockhart would have enthused, \"This is for all the skinny girls!\" upon receiving an award. There would have been no end to denouncing such a woman as being unhealthy, both physically and mentally, and contributing to the eating disorders of impressionable young girls."}
{"id": "bag-1450", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "Everything in the green world here in DC is popping, snapping, opening, rising, jumping out of the ground, from the little casings that hold the tree blooms, from the tips of the branches. It is like a slo-mo explosion of color outside. This is the great crescendo of spring in the American midatlantic. Oh my. I find spring here, by turns, overwhelming, irritating, and unbelievably beautiful. Every year, including this year of course, spring blows me away. There are days when I dance in shamanic alignment with the colors and shapes, when I become more vivid, put on a deep shade of pink lipstick and extra mascara. Other days I just want to run away from it all, go north or head out west past the Rockies, to places less verdant and therefore more peaceful. My respiratory system reacts as if it has been attacked which is the very reason I went forth this morning to buy bucketsfull of allergy meds. This year I'm trying Zyrtec, a more virile 24 hour concoction than the Claritin I usually take. I'm diving into the big antihistamines this year because I have a feeling that after our cold, snowy winter, this spring is going to be extra powerful. Judging by the way everything seems to be blooming all at once, I'm thinking my prediction is spot on. Gird your loins, people. Spring has sprung! Across the bar at Founding Farmers. Oh the rain, it does not stop. We've had three or four days of steady, soft, warm rain. I am not complaining. Those of us who suffer from springtime allergies welcome rain. It gathers the pollen and brings it down to the ground, a Very Good Thing. The rain, along with the mild head cold I'm just recovering from, has provided an excuse to just sit around. I've been watching Carl Sagan videos (of which there are a zillion on the internet) almost obsessively. I am completely fascinated - not so much by the science he describes as by his point of view. Only thirty years ago, we Americans were still dramatically Europe-centric, human-as-supreme-species-centric. To a fault, we believed our culture to be the center of the world. It kind of blows me away, realizing how much of an effect revisionist history has had not only on the humanities, but on the sciences as well. Our Ptolemaic view of what western culture is/was, i.e. the center of the world, has completely changed during the last few decades. How did it happen? When did it happen? How was it that we were finally able to admit that there have been many great, complex and interesting cultures in the history of the world, that many species have great intelligence? When did we open our minds? Did the spirit of Copernicus whisper in our collective ears? What happened to change the paradigm? I have no clue. Do you? On the Metro train, a great common denominator of humanity. Only because I think Brian Cox is the coolest rock star physicist ever, and because he raves about it, I've been watching old episodes of Cosmos with Carl Sagan (on hulu.com). I am so enjoying it. Cosmos is an icon of its time, (as is all art as well as all science). Though Sagan was the grooviest of groovies, seen through the lens of the decades that have passed since the series was made, his point of view is quaint to my modern sensibility. He speaks repeatedly of the \"dominating intelligence\" of human beings, and disparages the idiocy of nuclear weapons, for instance. I'm not clear that anyone I know actually sees nuclear war as a real possibility anymore. It was so of that time. Also, since the 1970's when Cosmos was made, we've stopped thinking of ourselves as a dominating intelligence, at least within the realm of popular science shows. These days, in most science documentaries, we focus on global warming and the loss of so many species on earth. We endlessly blame ourselves for every damn thing. That's one reason I have come to dislike science museums. It's all about how bad we are these days, rather than about science. Such a gloomy way to look at the marvels of our reality, don't you think? (Not to excuse our wastefulness or mindlessness, should say.) One thing we have now that we didn't have then are incredible special effects. In the 1970's there was no such thing as the Hubbel telescope either, so we didn't have all the stunning pictures of stars and planets, in HD, to work with. I don't get BBC TV on the cable here in the house on Tennessee Avenue, so I'll have to wait until Brian Cox's The Seven Wonders of the Solar System finds its way onto the internet to see full episodes. I'm content in the meantime to walk down memory lane with Carl Sagan and his essentially psychedelic 1970's worldview of science. I wonder how Brian Cox will look thirty years from now? Hmmm... From wikipedia: A virus (from the Latin virus meaning toxin or poison) is a small infectious agent that can replicate only inside the cells of other organisms. Viruses infect all types of organisms, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea. There are millions of different types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and these minute structures are the most abundant type of biological entity. So there really is no contest, no point in even trying to fight it. When the nasty cold virus decides it's time to take a bite out of me, I might as well submit, right? Ahhhhh-choooo! But even as I engage in typical down-with-a-cold behaviors: you know, drinking tea and leaving a trail of crumpled kleenexes in my wake, I always wonder WHY? Why did I catch this cold? Did the ghosts get to me in some way I was unaware of? Was it the extra-dynamic acupuncture I had this week? Did some early season allergy thing kick it into gear? The WHY ME thought form is no doubt left over from my years on the west coast where I believe it's a cultural imperative to believe that all illness happens for a reason. (Here on the east coast, we don't believe in minor illness. At the first sign of a cold, we swallow some toxic, over the counter medicine and go back to work. End of story.) Maybe today, while it rains and the virus parties in my sinuses, I should get myself back into what I think of as the midwestern mindset, which is: when you get a cold, get in bed, watch movies, read magazines and sleep a lot. I love the midwestern sensibility. Ahhh ... common sense! Now excuse me while I blow my nose - again! No, this isn't the haunted house, just another beautiful Capitol Hill house. I wanted to take a picture of the haunted house, but as soon as I aimed my camera towards the window where I saw the ghost's face, my trusty camera switched itself off and refused to come back on ... until later, on the Metro train, on my way home. Even though I believe in all kinds of mysteries, incidents like this still surprise me. A minute later the woman who called me about the haunting mentioned that after she and her husband moved in, every one of the kitchen appliances died, one by one, one each day until the whole kitchen was kaput. The night that the last appliance broke down, she heard kitchen cabinets opening and closing all night long. Even her husband heard it, and he is not given to thinking about or believing in psychic phenomena. Poor guy. He is in for one crazy ride. Even after yesterday, I still maintain that the White House is the most haunted house I have ever encountered, but this house in Alexandria? A very close second. There is so much going on there, indoors and out, that it would take several blog posts to describe all the energy. Briefly, surrounding the house are the remains of a Civil War hospital, adjacent to a Civil War battlefield. On the other side of the house is a new housing development. Land spirits really hate housing developments. And now here she is, rebuilding the foundation of the house which is, itself, completely full of what appears to my inner eye to be a family of ghosts. There are several generations of ghosts there, some it seems, from the \"old country\" wherever that is, some who lived in the house. The energy is so strong that at one point, wandering around, I mentioned that I was very dizzy. The woman said, \"I stay away from that corner.\" I found many areas of dizzy energy in the house which is laid out like a maze. I wonder who designed it. It's like an Escher house with stairs going up and down, landings everywhere. To get from one end of the house to the other involves following a tremendously circuitous route. Crazy. I can see why the movers were reluctant to go inside. Believe me, that house is haunted! So I didn't do anything but ring the Tibetan singing bowl in the dizzy corner. It never hurts to ring the bowl, especially at times when I have no idea where to start. For the time being, the residents of the house are content to sit with the energy. She said things had calmed down during the past week, so maybe the ghost family has welcomed her. When I got back to the Hill I took a very long walk, let the breeze and the light of the setting sun clear away all that energy. There are hauntings and there are hauntings. The place I visited yesterday? All I can say is Wow. Pennsylvania Avenue by the IMF, close to Founding Farmers, my very favorite restaurant in Washington. On my calendar for today is an appointment to go see about a haunting in Alexandria. I'm looking forward to the experience as I have a special affection for ghosts. They remind me of all the stoners I used to hang out with. What am I saying? They remind me of ME when I was a stoner, kind of fuzzy around the edges, unable to focus most of the time. Ghosts get disoriented, they lose track of time, can't quite remember, most of the time, that they're dead. Sometimes they remember their deaths and freak out for awhile - that's when they moan and shriek and groan. But five minutes later they've forgotten all about it again. I swear ghosts are so stoned! They don't really get the living, either. I'm pretty sure they can't tell the difference between when we're awake and asleep, which is why they're always trying to talk to us while we're sleeping. We're quiet, not rushing around, when we're asleep. We switch off the lights, tv, computers, ipods, etc. when we sleep. I think they feel we are more approachable without all the noise and distraction. The people who called me about the haunting just bought a house that's registered with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It's close to a Civil War battlefield, but not right on top of it, which could be a factor in the haunting, though the woman who contacted me says she thinks it might be a female. Even the movers, burly dudes (as she described them) thought they saw someone looking out a window on the second floor. It won't surprise anyone who has known me for awhile that I plan to bring a small hand mirror with me today. I like to walk around haunted houses looking at a reflection of the space. Sometimes I can \"see\" things in the mirror I wouldn't notice if I was looking directly at them. I'll bring my Tibetan singing bowl and the purbha that Butternut Squash (of the blog Goddess of the Confluence) gave me. Sometimes the clear tone of the bowl is all a spirit needs to snap out of her dreamstate and move along. Sometimes it takes more than that. I also always take a rattle. Ghosts don't really like rattles, which is one reason it's traditional to give rattles to babies - to keep the ghosts away. But it does get them all stirred up, makes them more visible. It's a small annoyance I always apologize for. And my camera. Of course I'll take my camera. Though dubious that I'll capture the ghost digitally, it's always worth having the camera at the ready, just in case. The next time I complain about my life, I hope someone will remind me that actually my life is SO interesting! Yes? I say yes. While one of my housemates is in Spain, I'm in charge of walking his dog. I tend to walk the dogs anyway, whenever it suits me, but I'll admit that since Jake died, I've been a lot lazier than I used to be, sleeping in, reading blogs until 10 a.m. when I finally boost myself out the door. Tonka is a boisterous, energetic beast, much the way Jake was at the same age (five), so I'm up and out the door early every day, back out midday and once again in the evening. I am becoming reaquainted with the routes I used to take but abandoned after Jake, routes on which there's plenty of grass to provide inspiration, good smells, and easy to scoop locations. I keep seeing people I haven't seen since last summer, out with their dogs. Walking Tonka has provided access to dog society, synched my rhythms with those of many wonderful neighbors. When Jake died a whole culture disappeared before my very eyes. I'm a part of it again for the time being, which is so nice. I'm no longer grieving for Jake so it's not hard to explain to these people that no, Tonka is not my new dog. For a long time after Jake died, I choked up anytime anyone mentioned him. I'm asked every morning, after I explain about Tonka, when I'll get a new dog. All I can do is shrug my shoulders and say I don't know. I have no desire to get a new dog. Is that normal? Jake was the only dog I've ever had, perhaps ever will have. Who knows? One thing I'm re-learning is how much I love to walk around the neighborhood first thing in the morning when the day is fresh, the birds are singing and all seems peaceful and new. I'm grateful for this dog walking gig, I am. The weather has completely turned, and though I'm certain we will see more cold, raw, early spring days, winter is definitely done. Today Brother Sun will bring the thermometer up to 65 F. Ahhhh ... that's almost warm! Naturally I am feeling overambitious, as befits a sparkling early spring day. My to do list goes on and on. And on. According to the cosmology of Reya, springtime overambitiousness is a natural reaction to the upwards surging energy of spring. It is so strong today that I feel kind of superhero-ish. Where did I put my cape and funny mask? Where are my tights?? TODAY I WILL SAVE THE WORLD! Err ... or ... maybe not. But maybe I'll get the laundry done, the groceries purchased, and my room cleaned. Maybe the dogs will get a super-long walk, maybe I'll take some nice pictures, maybe I'll make a spinach salad after I meet my friend for a martini. It's probably enough, isn't it? I mean, if I'm only able to \"save\" my little corner of the world today? It's OK not to be a superhero, right? Yes? I say yes."}

Important things: Where is that road to being a good person I was looking for the other day?? You get the idea.\n\nWell, last weekend I was jamming to my uber cool running mix which you better believe includes Jay-Z. Have I mentioned that our romance back from the Hard Knock Life days has been rekindled? As his voice soothed my soul, I was trying to picture Jay-Z sitting down to write some songs............and I started laughing out loud. I mean, does he list out words that rhyme? Is he pulling out his pocket thesaurus?? I'm just having a hard time picturing this! I think it must just come out perfect when he goes to the studio the first time. That is the only way it can work out in my mind.\n\nI used to write poetry in high school, which colors my ideas about brainstorming and writing or doing anything creative. Cheers to Jay-Z for beating me at this process. I never tried to rap though. Maybe that's easier. I should add free-style rapping to my list of goals I have going. More amusing things for you to read about.\n\nPretty sure I'll need to pick the optimal time to test out this free-style rapping, like, oh, I don't know, maybe during an interview. I will be going on lots of those soon. My future employers will need to know that I'm creative. Perfect way to show them! Or maybe I should do it at HEB the next time I go and almost die by being stampeded in the dairy section. Those people are on a MISSION I tell you. I have been trapped there on multiple occasions. I'm sure if I were rapping at people they might make a path for me, my eggs and my milk.\n\nI'm not lying when I say that I observed a very painful first date on Millionaire Match Maker which included a free style rap from the girl to the guy. He decided she was crazy. Maybe I'll be better than her.\n\nWell, I should go review common rhymes and do some brainstorming so I'm ready when the perfect opportunity presents itself. Does that negate the free-ness of the styling? I'm going with no."}

This weekend lentils sounded really good, so I dug out my favorite lentil soup recipe and tried a new lentil \u201cburger\u201d recipe. Thought I\u2019d share them both with you. \n\nI can\u2019t remember where I got this soup recipe, so I apologize to whomever I lifted this from. I modified it a bit, but it\u2019s not originally my recipe. \n\nLentil Vegetable Soup\nMakes 6 2-cup servings\n\n1 large onion, chopped\n2-3 cloves garlic, chopped\n1 t ground cumin\n2 t chili powder\n3 C veggie broth\n1 C dried lentils (I sometimes use \u00bd C of lentils to make it more soupy)\n1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained (fire-roasted is fabulous!)\n1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce\n1 can (4.5 oz) chopped green chilies, undrained\n1 C frozen corn\n2 medium carrots, chopped (about 2 cups)\n2 small zucchini, diced (about 2 cups)\n\nSpray a 3-quart saucepan with cooking spray and saut\u00e9 onion, garlic, spices in a little veggie broth until veggies are soft. Add everything else, cover and simmer for 35-45 minutes, depending on how soft you like your lentils. \n\nI modified a lentil meatball recipe that I found through Loser For Life Marisa\u2019s blog. She originally got from In Jennie\u2019s Kitchen. I made 8 patties rather than 18 meatballs and I\u2019m using them like veggie burgers. \n\nThe original recipe is below with my modifications in parenthesis. \n\nLentil Ricotta Meatballs\nMakes about 18\n\n2 cups cooked lentils, pureed (I cooked them in vegetable broth rather than plain water)\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten (1/2 C Egg Beaters)\n2/3 cup plain breadcrumbs (I ground 2/3 C regular oatmeal)\n1/2 cup fresh ricotta (I used low-fat ricotta)\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n1 1/2 teaspoon chopped parsley\nSalt and freshly ground pepper, to taste\n\nJennie\u2019s cooking instructions: Add all ingredients to a deep bowl. Mix very well, using hands or a wooden spoon. Cover and refrigerate for two hours or overnight.\n\nWhen ready to cook, shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Heat about 1/2-inch of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium flame. Add shaped \u201cmeatballs\u201d and cook until browned all around, turning only once. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and let excess drain off. Add to simmering marinara sauce if serving immediately, or store in a tightly covered container up to three days.\n\nLynn\u2019s burger instructions: Preheat oven to 375. Lightly spray a baking sheet. Add all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties (they will seem runny, but they\u2019ll hold together, I promise) and place on baking sheet. Bake 20-30 minutes and flip them. Bake an additional 15-20 minutes or until they are brown. \n\nNote: I didn\u2019t cover and refrigerate for two hours, but I might try that next time if I\u2019m not pressed for time. They turned out very nicely anyway. I\u2019m having a leftover burger for lunch today so I\u2019ll see how well they do in the fridge. I also put three in the freezer to see how they fare that way, too. \n\nI\u2019ll probably make them as meatballs at some point, too, and mix them with my homemade sauce and Shiratake noodles. \n\nForgive the short blog.

The animal we seek to master is impossible to tame, if merely for the fact that the algorithm behind the Google search engine is never really still. Stable, arguably so, but the fact remains that engineer upon engineer, programmer after programmer are spending their time constantly tweaking the code and structure of Google, often leading to unexpected twists in the SEO trail.\n\nThe point that I\u2019m getting at is that as a marketing expert, Search professional, or SEO company, one must be prepared to change with the times. Resistant to change some of us may well be, but change we must, if we are to survive. Of course, some changes are easier to accommodate for than others, some are small, some are large, the difficulty to change with the times sometimes \u2013 but not always \u2013 scales with the size of the change.\n\nHowever, once in a while comes a change that is just incredibly awkward to deal with. A change that is so downright frustrating that it makes you wonder why you ever got into this business. A change like that has happened in recent days and continues to still happen. That change is typically referred to as \u201cpersonalised search\u201d, the process via which a Google search can become \u201cpersonalised\u201d or \u201cunique\u201d for a given user, particularly when logged in to one\u2019s own Gmail/Google account.\n\nIt works by giving alarming priority to popular branded sites (presumably ones that Google thinks has a high amount of \u201ctrust\u201d built up) and pushes these to the top of related search results, so you end up being more likely to find these branded sites in a better position than other, smaller, \u201cless trusted\u201d websites. This also has a literal knock-on effect of pushing the websites that were previously ranking well for related keywords (the smaller sites) out of the way entirely, as they\u2019re moved to one side to make room for the \u201cbig ones\u201d. From an SEO point of view, I\u2019m sure you can understand the frustration here."}

I just want Will to say some words, I don't give a rats ass how he pronounces them).  Anyway, Will wanted to say hi to the baby so we ventured over.  This led to a bizarre exchange.  Well, exchange by them to me, where I stood looking back and forth like a tennis match until the librarian came over and booted them out for talking so loud.\n\nThey asked how old Will was and I told them...and the flood started.  In a matter of seconds, I learned where the babies outfit and sling came from, that she sleeps through the night and had for months (no, no, no people some of us weren't that lucky, and we REALLY dislike these stories) OH and that she can play the organ for twenty minutes at a time.\n\nMaybe it was good for me to run into them because it made me realize that not everyone wants to hear every little thing about your kid - even if you think it's totally adorable (like how Will now has to sleep with the book that he picked out which is literally as tall as him).

Hayden was fond of saying that when it came to handling high value terror suspects, he would play in fair territory, but with \"chalk dust on my cleats.\" Four legal memos released last week by the Obama Administration make it clear that the referee role in CIA interrogations was played by its medical and psychological personnel.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, which authored the memos, legal approval to use waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and other abusive techniques pivoted on the existence of a \"system of medical and psychological monitoring\" of interrogations. Medical and psychological personnel were the arbiters of torture, assigned to monitor interrogations and intervene to ensure that interrogators didn't cause \"serious or permanent harm\" and thus violate the U.S. Federal statute against torture.\n\nThe reasoning sounds almost circular. As one memo, from May 2005, put it: \"The close monitoring of each detainee for any signs that he is at risk of experiencing severe physical pain reinforces the conclusion that the combined use of interrogation techniques is not intended to inflict such pain.\"\n\nIn other words, as long as medically trained personnel were present and approved of the techniques being used, it was not torture.\n\nThe memos provide official confirmation of both much-reported and previously unknown roles of doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and other medical personnel with the CIA's Office of Medical Services. The government's lawyers characterized these medical roles as \"safeguards\" for detainees.\n\nMedical oversight was present from the beginning of the special interrogation program following the 9/11 attacks, and appears to have grown more formalized over the program's existence. The earliest of the four memos, from August 2002, states that a medical expert with experience in the military's Survival Evasion Resistance, Escape (\"SERE\") training would be present during waterboarding of detainee Abu Zubaydah, and would put a stop to procedures \"if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe medical or physical harm to Zubaydah.\" (All interrogation techniques, the memos said, were \"imported\" from SERE.)\n\nLater, the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) personnel were involved in \"designing safeguards for, and in monitoring implementation of, the procedures\" used on other high value detainees. In December 2004, the OMS produced a set of \"Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Rendition, Interrogation and Detention,\" a still-secret document that is heavily quoted from in three legal memos that were written the following year.\n\nThe CIA declined our request to comment further on the OMS's role in detainee treatment. The OMS employs physicians, psychologists and other medical professionals to care for CIA employees and their families.\n\nPerhaps the most chilling aspect of the memos is their intimation that medical professionals conducted a form of research on the detainees, clearly without their consent. \"In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented,\" one memo reads. The documentation included not only how long the procedure lasted, how much water was used and how it was poured, but also \"if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled....and how the subject looked between each treatment.\" Special instructions were also issued with regard to documenting experience with sleep deprivation, and \"regular reporting on medical and psychological experiences with the use of these techniques on detainees\" was required.\n\nThe Nuremberg Code, adopted after the horrors of \"medical research\" during the Nazi Holocaust, requires, among other things, the consent of subjects and their ability to call a halt to their participation.\n\nThe memos also draw heavily on the advice of psychologists that interrogation techniques would not be expected to cause lasting harm. At times this advice sounds contradictory. While calling waterboarding \"medically acceptable,\" the OMS also deemed it \"the most traumatic of the enhanced interrogation techniques.\"\n\nThe fact that traumatic events have the potential to cause long-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome has been well documented. Physicians for Human Rights, in interviews with eleven former detainees held in Iraq and Afghanistan, found \"severe, long-term physical and psychological consequences.\" \"All the individuals we evaluated were ultimately released without ever being charged,\" said Dr. Allen Keller, medical director of the Bellevue/New York University School of Medicine Program for Survivors of Torture.\n\nThe memos describe the techniques in highly precise and clinical detail, befitting a medical textbook. During water boarding, in which a physician and psychologist were to be present at all times, \"the detainee is monitored to ensure that he does not develop respiratory distress. If the detainee is not breathing freely after the cloth is removed from his face, he is immediately moved to a vertical position in order to clear the water from his mouth, nose and nasopharynx.\" Side effects including vomiting, aspiration and throat spasm that could cut off breathing were each addressed: \"In the event of such spasms...if necessary, the intervening physician would perform a tracheotomy.\"\n\nWhile physician assistants could be present when most \"enhanced\" techniques were applied, \"use of the waterboard requires the presence of a physician,\" one memo said, quoting the OMS Guidelines.\n\nDoctors were also described as having vetted the practices for safety. Certain limits on waterboarding were created \"with extensive input from OMS.\" One memo states that OMS \"doctors and psychologists\" confirmed that combining the various techniques \"would not operate in a different manner from the way they do individually, so as to cause severe pain.\"\n\nMedical and psychological personnel were required to observe whenever interrogators came into physical contact with detainees, including slapping them and pushing them into flexible walls (\"walling\"). Whenever a detainee was doused with cold water, a medical officer had to be on hand to monitor for signs of hypothermia. Confining prisoners to cramped boxes required \"continuing consultation between the interrogators and OMS officers.\" Prisoners made to stand for long periods to prevent sleep were to carefully monitor detainees for swelling of the legs and other dangerous conditions, and at least three times early in the program were switched, on medical advice, to \"horizontal sleep deprivation.\"\n\nThis was one example of how medical personnel could, according to the CIA, help prevent \"severe physical or mental pain or suffering\" on the part of the detainees. However the memos show that the OMS's role was not merely to limit the medical impact of interrogations, but also to consult on the effectiveness of interrogations. A May 30, 2005 memo quotes the OMS suggesting that cramped confinement was \"not...particularly effective\" because it provides \"a safe haven offering respite from interrogation.\"\n\nMonitoring interrogations is a role that the American Medical Association, among others, has rejected, pointing out that the presence of physicians or other medical personnel could paradoxically make interrogations more dangerous. As Keller explains it: \"The interrogator may think well, the health professional will stop me if I go too far. The health professional is thinking I'm really here at the behest of the CIA. There's a tension of dual loyalty.\"\n\nJust as officials in the Justice Dept. now condemn waterboarding as torture, so, too, did opinion change at another organization, the American Psychological Association. In the frightening days following the 9/11 attacks, \"there were two schools of thoughts in the psychological community. One was if you were there on the ground you could do some good,\" said APA spokesperson Rhea Farberman, whose organization was criticized for originally taking that position. The group's current stance is to forbid psychologists from participating, she said. \"If you are there on the ground, you may be seen as condoning the behavior.\"\n\nSome medical professionals are calling for colleagues to be investigated and sanctioned. But finding out which professionals were involved in designing, monitoring and implementing the interrogation techniques may be difficult. The four memos were released almost in their entirety. The few redactions concerned mainly the names of the personnel involved."}

Soon all the things I have routinely done at home will come to a halt: baking, gardening, & park day. I will instead spend the weekends working shows in Virginia and Maryland visiting with friends, sleeping in different beds and driving rental vans. I will not be able to lean on Paul to back me up. \n\nFor many months I had the regularity of meditation and exercise keeping me on track, I was feeling good about going into the new working year, but for the past 2 months I have had a swollen knee due to a torn meniscus, which has put a halt to the intense work out I was enjoying. I'm not sure why I lost the Breathe.\n\nI don't hold onto familiarity and I am not dependent on regularity. I have never really felt settled anywhere. Many, many years ago I was working on the Celestine Prophecy workbook and one of the tasks was to connect the dots that lead to where you are now. In other words what events brought me here, right now. The goal was to understand that there are always many choices we can make, and the one we do make is significant to where we go: It is what we do in the moment that leads to the next moment. I believe I understand with such clarity why I chose to live on St. Thomas because it had everything I \"thought I wanted\" and everything I really did want.\n\nI often wonder why I moved to Las Vegas. What is the lesson? What was the need?\n\nI believe I moved to Las Vegas, to learn how to be a better parent. I moved here to meet more people who reassure me that by listening to my gut, connecting with my child, and considering his father, I will make the best choices to leave upon my son.\n\nAfter only a month of moving into our home, I contacted a homeschooling group, who's description appealed to me. \"We hope to support and inspire each other on our journeys of living and learning. Because respect for the child is at the core of unschooling, we expect our members to act accordingly on the list and in real life gatherings. We embrace diversity and hope that all who join our group will respect each others' differences and remain open to learning from each other.\" This group's members have changed since I first joined. There are only 3 families from our original beginnings that are still regulars in the group. Las Vegas, like St. Thomas is filled with transients. \n\nOne of the Four Noble Truths: The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. When I meet a friend I know they are not permanent, that my happiness does not rely on their being, but I know that just by calling them friend they have given me a little more understanding of my true self. They have left a lasting impression.\n\nAnother transient (though born here is leaving for life on the road) and one I call friend is leaving the LifeLearners, she is moving on, following her heart, facing her fears and becoming her true self. And again I realize that things will change. Our ego wants us to believe these changes are dramatic, but in reality they are subtle.\n\nMy ego misses my friend tonight. My ego sheds tears for the absent Wednesday chair.\n\nI am feeling shaken and stirred. It's time to remember to how to breathe."}
