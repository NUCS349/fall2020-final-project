I've been annoyed, in the \"evolutionary\" discussions of rape I've seen so far, by their careful avoidance of the fact that in the real world, rape is not considered such a bad thing after all, that women are presumed be wanting it secretly, and that men are constantly trying to construct scenarios in which a woman forfeits her right to say No."}

What ADSL achieved was to utilise frequencies available within old copper wires that were not required for voice transmissions; plugging in \u201cmicrofilters\u201d to each home phone socket meant that that the two channels were effectively split into separate lines, catering to data and calls respectively. The line is asymmetric because download speeds are greater than upload speeds. Although not ideal for every purpose, that does make relatively passive, consumer browsing much more possible.\n\nThe history of the web\u2019s development has shaped the internet, too: video conferencing, for instance, was hailed as the 'next big thing\u2019, but simply wouldn\u2019t work without higher upload rates. And websites have looked as they do \u2013 usually static \u2013 because the premium was on how much data would fit down each pipe. That history of pre-broadband internet continues to shape many of the websites we have today.\n\nBut as broadband access was rolled slowly out across the country, its limitations have become clearer \u2013 ideally, it only runs up to two miles from an exchange, although five is possible. And as technology has fostered cleverer websites, the need for better broadband has led to the so-called \u201cdigital divide\u201d between the haves and the have nots.\n\nNext week, we\u2019ll look at the state of the broadband nation."}

The slide deck is embedded below, and Martin Langeveld has a great overview at the Nieman Journalism Lab that also includes a transcript of Varian\u2019s presentation. The Google economist (who also wrote a blog post) does a pretty thorough job of explaining the untenable position that newspapers currently find themselves in, and how it isn\u2019t the Internet\u2019s fault (in other words, it isn\u2019t Google\u2019s fault).\n\nThe biggest problem, Varian says, is that the news part of what newspapers do \u2014 the hard reporting and crime and investigative stuff that everyone thinks of when they say the word \u201cjournalism\u201d \u2014 has traditionally been subsidized by all the rest of what newspapers do, such as the automotive section, the travel section, the lifestyle features and so on (which almost no one thinks of when they say the word \u201cjournalism\u201d). Those other parts of the paper, unfortunately, are being targeted by subject-specific web sites and services, leaving the news part of the operation unprotected. As he put it:\n\n    Traditionally, the ad revenue from these special sections has been used to cross-subsidize the core news production. Nowadays internet users go directly to websites like Edmunds, Orbitz, Epicurious, and Amazon to look for products and services in specialized areas. Not surprisingly, advertisers follow those eyeballs, which makes the traditional cross-subsidization model that newspapers have used far more difficult.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s admittedly a bit presumptuous to expect Varian to come up with solutions to this problem, he\u2019s a little light on the solutions front, mentioning Google\u2019s \u201cFastFlip\u201d experiment as one possible answer, as well as Living Stories and a couple of other Google projects. But one part of his presentation really hit home with me, and that was when he talked about the amount of time people spend with the news online. On average, he said, they spend about 70 seconds a day. Varian says part of the reason for that is people reading online at work, where they have less time to spend with the news."}

According to Telltale PR manager Chris Schmidt, pre-ordering the full pack will reduce the cost to $29.99, a minor but not unwelcome discount from the regular price of $34.95.\n\nSpeaking to Joystiq at a meeting during the Game Developers Conference on Friday, Schmidt also addressed the obvious question: Will this season of Sam & Max come to Xbox 360 or Wii? He called it a \"definite possibility\" a few months down the line, and noted that it's in Telltale's best interest to work with more partners and deliver its games to as wide an audience as possible.

Yesterday's submission by Randy C. outs Gary Pool as a repeat offender . &nbsp;Today it's a POOL TABlE SAlE. &nbsp;Randy explains: I spotted this one on Niagara Falls Boulevard in Amherst, NY. &nbsp;In the summer this business sells swimming pools and during the winter they turn to indoor entertainment items such as pool tables . Seems that Gary is short on uppercase L's for his readerboard. Trying to get back into the swing of posting more regularly, I was encouraged by Randy C of Cheektowaga, NY, to post more frequently. &nbsp;He tells his tale: I spotted this one on Niagara Falls Boulevard in Amherst, NY, soon after the Buffalo Home and Garden Show. &nbsp;Of secondary interest is the lower case \"o\" in the word \"show.\" I pass this business three times a week and have gotten so I always check out their sign. &nbsp;Is this just a clever way to get people to notice their business? Just for fun, I've included a second photo to place the sign in context. Not the SPECIAl on this blog. &nbsp;Also reminds me of a&nbsp; POOl &nbsp;or two . SWINE FlU GONE TOO FAR, indeed! &nbsp;Dylan C. from Cairo, NY explained that this was a 12th grader's class assignment. &nbsp;Looks like swine flu &nbsp;is beginning to take a toll on lowercase L judgment ... and education. This is not the first case of FlU we've caught here. Lowercase L errors are usually ephemeral, written on cardboard, scribbled on scrap paper, or arranged with letter tiles on a roadside readerboard. &nbsp;But once in a great while, a lowercase L makes a mark of permanence in the world, and it simply cannot be ignored. Such is the case with the flawed 50-peso coins minted in Chile in 2008 . &nbsp;Surprisingly, no one noticed the misspelled CHIlE until just a few weeks ago. &nbsp;Are people so used to writing lowercase L's among all uppercase letters that everyone thought this was passable? This could be a result of mistaking the uppercase i stamp for an L stamp, or the error could have followed a poorly handwritten note that instructed the Chilean minter to cast the letters CHIlE in metal. &nbsp;Or perhaps there was a conspiracy to inject the market for erroneous coins with fresh material. Either way, this may be bigger than the Manhattan Project incident . Thanks to Adrian Bailey for passing along this news! Lisa B. found this LOBSTER ClAM SAUCE at Moby Dick Restaurant on the wharf in Santa Barbara. Funny that the author almost lost it with the weak uppercase L in SALMON, fully recovered with LOBSTER, and then totally fell apart with the ClAM. It's easy to ignore the lowercase L problem when it doesn't impact our lives in any way other than annoyance or mild confusion. But when someone attacks the family name, it hits too close to home for comfort. That's how Morgan Holzer felt when he read this sign being held by the car service driver at the airport. It reads like a McKenzie Brothers Canadian insult ... Take off, you HOlZER & MORGAN! Yitz Complicated shares this apropos trailer with lowercase L readers, figuring we like this kind of stuff."}

Depending on your personal preferences, that's either a canny marketing decision or a cynical bit of cheap design trickery. The silver and grey styling of the buttons and sides of the phone don't sit quite as well with the otherwise glossy white colour scheme of the phone, although again that's a matter of personal preference.\n\nThe Xphone IIm is a candybar form factor smartphone that's fairly reminiscent of most of Sony Ericsson's designs, right down to the largish 2.2 inch screen and small button array. Most functions are controlled via the tiny directional joystick that sits in the middle of the phone, in the same style as the Xphone II itself. The major button difference between the IIm and II is the addition of four dedicated function buttons. These are mapped to Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player functions.\n\nThe Xphone IIm weighs in at 106.5g with battery and measures 46.83 x 107.76 x 19.58 mm. The real advantage with this style of smartphone over the massed army of iPaq form factor clones is that they'll fit comfortably in any pocket and don't immediately look like a PDA - although that's an approach that does have its drawbacks, which we'll get to shortly.\n\nFeatures\nAs a phone, the Xphone IIm is a tri-band GSM phone with GPRS capabilities and Bluetooth connectivity. The whole platform's running on the somewhat aging Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 Smartphone Edition software, which both manages usual phone functionality as well as PDA-style applications. The IIm also features an integrated VGA camera located on the back of the phone.\n\nThe supplied application package - predominantly Pocket Outlook and Internet Explorer - isn't that exciting in PDA terms, although at least running on the Windows Mobile 2003 platform means that there's plenty of potential add-on software out there to bolster the phone's capabilities. The trick there, however, will be making sure that you can control said software via the tiny joystick, as the IIm offers no touchscreen capabilities, unlike larger PDA-style smartphones.\n\nPerformance\nThere's not too much that can be said about the IIm's phone performance, as it worked well enough during our testing for both phone calls and SMS/MMS messaging. Our one complaint is a relatively minor one, in that while the phone itself supports Windows Media player, it doesn't support MP3 ring tones; quite how annoying you'll find that is up to you.\n\nAs a PDA, the IIm has some distinct drawbacks, centred mainly around the mandatory use of the joystick. It takes quite a bit of use to get accustomed to using the joystick for menu navigation, especially if you're used to touchscreen smartphones. If you're in possession of small and nimble fingers you'll have no problems with the IIm's joystick, but our rather meatier digits found it irksome, especially as it's all too easy to hit the function buttons above it by accident when scrolling upwards. There are also some applications, such as the normally highly addictive Jawbreaker, that work very poorly through a joystick interface."}

In light of the fact that in all other respects DSM-IV bipolar and DSM-5 bipolar are virtually identical, this is a very significant development. The current DSM recognizes mixed states only when full-blown depression is accompanied by full-blown mania. Thus: at least five (of nine) depression symptoms accompanied by at least four (of seven) mania symptoms. Technically, then, only those with bipolar I qualify. But in the real world, individuals may experience depression accompanied by only two or three mania/hypomania symptoms. Or mania with just two or three depression symptoms. Don't these symptoms somehow count? Yes, says Ellen Frank PhD of the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview several years ago, Dr Frank explained to me that \u201ceven isolated symptoms that don't cluster together to create episodes may be important.\" A 2004 study she collaborated on with Giovanni Cassano MD of the University of Pisa found that just one symptom of mania (the symptom list in the study was much longer and more refined than the DSM list) in unipolar depression increased risk for suicidal ideation 4.2 percent. More symptoms kept upping the risk. So what do we do with these so-called unipolars? Treat them as if they had pure depression? According to Hagop Akiskal MD of UCSD, in a journal article, \u201cthe nonrecognition of depressive mixed state is nothing short of a clinical tragedy because these are the very 'unipolar' depressive patients who are likely to do poorly on antidepressants \u2026\u201d These would be your agitated depressions, an unbearable energized psychic pain. Looking at it from the mania/hypomania side of the divide: In a 2003 grand rounds lecture at UCLA, Trisha Suppes MD, PhD of Stanford described having an epiphany while reading the DSM criteria for hypomania. \"I said, wait, where are all those patients of mine who are hypomanic and say they don't feel good?\""}

Eventually, the police catch up with him and he\u2019s sent to jail where he falls even more madly for young, softly-spoken Phillip (Ewan McGregor).\n\nThey will, he vows, never be apart. Even if that means, upon being released, pretending to be a lawyer to get his lover out of jail, blagging a job as a high-ranking financial executive to fund an opulent life for the two of them, upon being sent back to jail conning medics that he\u2019s dying of AIDS the better to effect an escape plan.\n\nHe\u2019s outrageous.\n\nYet, unlike Matt Damon\u2019s serial deceiver in The Informant!, he doesn\u2019t seem sad or pitiable. If he\u2019s a monster, he\u2019s a charming one. Perhaps he\u2019s in the grip of a compulsion. Perhaps his desire to be and do everything for Phillip marks him as a power freak.\n\nIt\u2019s hard though not to envy his energy and guile. After all, when you love someone don\u2019t you move heaven and earth to be and do everything for that person? This isn\u2019t a satire or a cautionary tale: it\u2019s one of the most romantic, most inspiring films of recent years.\n\nWhat makes it especially arresting is its frankness. It\u2019s more queer than gay, avoiding the tragic homosexual themes of Brokeback Mountain, the stylised melancholy of A Single Man, or the activist agenda of Milk. When Steve tells Phillip he\u2019s taken up golf, his immediate response is: \u201cGolf? You\u2019re a homosexual!\u201d\n\nThere are scenes that depict kissing, sweatiness, and post-fellatio banter into all of which Carrey and McGregor, though they don\u2019t seem 100 per cent compatible, throw themselves whole-heartedly.\n\nThat whole-heartedness has its drawbacks. Carrey, in his best performance for a long time, still struggles to rein in his urge to over-gesticulate.

Then again, as this witty, engaging film proves, love has its own strange logic.  I Love You Phillip Morris begins with the opposite of a disclaimer. The words \u201cThis really happened\u201d appear on the screen.\n\nThen, just to make sure you know you\u2019re in for one of the most batty and scarcely believable biopics of recent times, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who together wrote and directed the film, add: \u201cIt really did.\u201d Steve Russell (played by Jim Carrey) is a conman who makes Bernie Madoff look small time. He joins the police force in order to get access to documents that will let him track down the mother who gave him up for adoption as a young child.

Below, a view of his bunk beds and office desk . THE political crisis in Brasilia continues with the Federal District Governor Jose Roberto Arruda still being held at the headquarters of the Federal Police, a month after he was accused of trying to obstruct an investigation into massive corruption in his administration. The threat of federal intervention in the governing of the Federal District has eased for the time being, with the federal Supreme Court loath to intervene in a district that was given political emancipation only in 1988. Last week the Federal District Assembly voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Arruda. If he does not resign before the process is over, which takes several months, he could see his political rights suspended for up to eight years. Last Saturday, two district representatives tried to serve Arruda with the notice of the impeachment proceedings, but he refused to receive it, later saying in a handwritten letter to the Federal District Assembly that he wanted access to the full report on his impeachment before accepting the notification. The representatives returned last Monday with two witnesses to corroborate that they had informed Arruda of the proceedings against him, and served him with the notice. Arruda\u2019s lawyers have been trying to get him moved to house arrest, something the Supreme Court justices have not been inclined to allow since this would facilitate his communication with supporters, and thus possibly make it easier for him to interfere in the Federal Police\u2019s ongoing investigation into corruption in his administration. The governor is currently allowed visits only from his immediate family and his lawyers. His wife Flavia brings him lunch everyday, although she is not allowed to be alone with him in his room. He is being held in a room of approximately 16.8 square meters in the Federal Police headquarters compound in Brasilia. He had previously been held in a room of 40 square meters. He has access to newspapers and magazines, but is not allowed access to television or telephones. His lawyers claimed that he was being held in a \u201cmasmorra\u201d, or a subterranean jail, which forced the Attorney General\u2019s office to release pictures last week of his quarters which showed the room had clean white walls, a bunk bed, an office desk, a small refrigerator, a little sofa and a window. Arruda\u2019s lawyers have also been claiming that the governor is suffering from pains in one of his ankles, which they claim is swollen and is linked to his diabetes. Two visits to a private hospital this week found Arruda in good health, taking away yet another reason his lawyers were trying to use to push for house arrest. The three-time former governor of the Federal District, Joaquim Roriz, who is now 75 years old, has been running political ads on television showing himself talking casually about the \u201cshame of corruption\u201d that is currently rocking Brasilia. Roriz is expected to run in the October elections for governor again. He has been embroiled in several corruption scandals in the past, which make his criticisms of Arruda extra ironic. Will voters here remember that when they go to the polls in October? One can only hope so. Jose Roberto Arruda, left, and Paulo Octavio in happier times. THE capital of Brazil, Brasilia, remained in a deep political crisis this week with the Distrito Federal Governor Jose Roberto Arruda still being held by the federal police for obstruction of an investigation of massive corruption involving the governor and at least 11 district representatives. Arrested on Feb. 11, at the beginning of Carnival, Arruda is being held at the headquarters of the Federal Police in Brasilia after he allegedly tried to bribe a local journalist to testify in his favor in the ongoing corruption investigation called \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d. The vice governor of the Federal District, the enormously wealthy and successful real estate tycoon Paulo Octavio, took over as acting governor when Arruda was arrested. But he too has been linked to the corruption scheme, and impeachment proceedings have been filed against him, as well as Arruda, by several district representatives. Octavio found that he had little support in the DF legislature and after only 11 days in office decided to resign last week. After a hurried meeting with Brazilian President Luis Inacio \u201cLula\u201d da Silva last week, he announced that he was holding off on resigning until this week, claiming that President Lula had asked him to wait a few more days. This was promptly denied by the presidential palace, which did not want the public to think that the president was supporting a politician under suspicion of corruption. Arruda was arrested upon request of the Attorney General Roberto Gurgel, who has repeatedly warned that there could be federal intervention in the governance of the Federal District if the local government does not get its act together. If the federal government stepped in, they would need to appoint someone to manage the capital at least until October when national elections are scheduled to take place and a new slate of politicians can be voted into office. The problem here is that the leading candidate expected to win the governor\u2019s race is Joaquim Roriz , a former three-time governor of the DF and federal senator, who had to resign from the Senate in 2007 in a corruption scandal in order to not have his political rights suspended for several years if he had been found guilty. The Pandora\u2019s Box investigation by the federal police came to public knowledge last year when hours of secretly filmed videotape was released by the police showing Arruda and several district representatives in different instances accepting large cash bribes and stuffing the money into their socks, underwear and handbags. The police claim these were regular kickbacks made over several years by businesses that had been given lucrative contracts with the Federal District government. These scenes caused a national outcry against such blatant greed and corruption when they were televised, although Arruda still maintains the payoffs were to fund the electoral campaigns of the politicians. Durval Barbosa, a former official in the DF government, who was involved in all of the payoffs, secretly filmed them in a deal he made with the Federal Police to help them in their investigation. In return he has been promised a reduced sentence. The Supreme Federal Court was originally scheduled to rule today on a habeus corpus motion by Arruda\u2019s lawyers, but has postponed any decision until next week after Arruda\u2019s lawyers asked for more time to study the original voting of the court which decided in favor of holding the governor. According to today\u2019s Correio Braziliense newspaper , 13 of the 15 justices, who heard the original petition to have Arruda arrested, voted in favor of his arrest. A district representative, Wilson Lima, is now the new acting governor of the Federal District. He was described by Octavio in an interview with the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper yesterday as \u201ca simple man\u201d. What remains to be seen is if Lima can stave off a federal intervention until the elections in October, and if Arruda, Octavio and the 11 district representatives will be tried in court for corruption. For too long disgraced politicians in Brazil have been able to cry on TV begging for forgiveness and then make a political comeback several years later as if nothing had happened. One can only hope that the memory of voters in the Federal District is not so short that they re-elect politicians that have proven in the past how rotten they really are. THE HASTILY announced new security measures implemented soon after the bungled Christmas Day attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ( photo at right ) to bomb a Delta jetliner approaching Detroit, of not being allowed on international flights to use the bathroom one hour before landing in the US or having a blanket on one\u2019s lap, were laughable despite the seriousness of the threat. One does not deny that there are growing numbers of Muslims around the world who are being radicalized and pushed into hating and wanting to harm the United States and its citizens. This is due to two reasons: The rise of radical and ultra-conservative Islam, fueled in large part by Saudi money, and the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. It is amazing that so many Americans still insist in solely viewing American imperial adventures abroad as do-good missions, swallowing hook, line and sinker the lie that America just wants to improve things in the Middle East. How can so many intelligent Americans not realize that in invading other countries, citizens of those countries just might harbor feelings of ill-will and resentment towards the invaders? It seems to be a logical and very human reaction to such a situation. Would Americans like it if Russia or China invaded the US to supposedly improve life for oppressed Americans? I hardly think so. The chorus of criticisms of the Obama administration\u2019s reaction to the failed bombing were right in pointing out the stupidity of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano\u2019s comment that \u201cthe system had worked\u201d when passengers and flight attendants overpowered Abdulmutallab, and in slamming President Obama\u2019s seeming lack of concern when he initially sent out advisers deal with the aftermath before finally holding a press conference himself. Napolitano had to quickly backtrack in the days following her inauspicious comment, especially when it became known that Abdulmutallab\u2019s own father had gone to the US Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, months ago to warn them about the radicalization of his son. An intelligence report was telegraphed back to Washington from the embassy and the Nigerian\u2019s name was placed on a watch list of half a million people. But he was not put on the much smaller no-fly list, and worst of all his two-year US visa was not cancelled immediately as it should have been. All passengers flying to the US have their names and passport details sent ahead when they check-in for their flights so that security checks can be made before someone believed to be a threat can even board a flight to the US. If his visa had been cancelled, and if the pre-flight verification system had worked, then Abdulmutallab would have never been allowed to board that Delta flight. It was the fast thinking action of a Dutch passenger which saved the day on that Delta flight when he leaped across rows of seats when he saw that Abdulmutallab was trying to set off a bomb, and grabbed the explosive device out of his hands, thereby saving the lives of nearly 300 people. Alert passengers and flight attendants on flights to and in the US are indeed the last line of defense between a terrorist and their success or lack thereof in blowing up or crashing a plane. The extra security measures announced this week for passengers flying to the US from 14 countries considered to harbor many potential terrorists with anti-US feelings, including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Algeria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen, seem unfair to me and are certainly not foolproof. Al-Qaeda or any other group could get around these new restrictions by recruiting disaffected American, French or British Muslims to carry out attacks on the US and Americans. Or they could use Indonesians, Indians, Filipinos or Chinese to carry out attacks. Americans and Europeans have to think strategically and cleverly in how to outfox the terrorists. Installing those huge imaging full body scanners at all major European and US airports would be a good beginning. They have hardly been used so far because of objections from privacy activists. But in this age of underwear bombers, these scanners have become more necessary than ever. Who cares if security screeners can see the outline of your entire body? Especially when the images are not stored and are deleted soon after being taken? Objections that screening all passengers with these machines would take far too much time could be remedied by randomly screening a certain number of passengers from each flight, no matter their nationality . In addition, Western countries need to be adept at sorting through and actually analyzing intelligently the avalanche of data and information that they are buried under on a daily basis. Firing a US intelligence analyst, who spoke fluent Arabic, just because he was gay, has to stop too. Apart from being homophobic and wrong, firing someone just because they are gay is silly when there are so few Americans who actually speak and write Arabic fluently. Western countries have to think outside the box and at the same time support progressive and moderate forces in Muslim countries so as not to alienate whole nations. Pulling out of Afghanistan would be a good first step. That war is unwinnable, and it is a shame that hundreds of young Americans and Europeans have given their lives for a country that does not want their help and an Afghan government that is riddled with corruption. And that too just so that Obama and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown can save face and not be accused of abandoning the fight. Afghanistan was never a good fight to begin with. Bush got us involved in that, Obama should now get us out. THE Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim and the commanders of the three major branches of the military all signed a joint resignation letter addressed to President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva last week over a proposed law that would have created a National Program of Human Rights and set up a truth commission that would have had the power to try military officials for human rights abuses committed during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. A sweeping amnesty law passed by Congress in 1979 gave protection from prosecution for any crimes committed by members of both the military and left-wing guerrilla groups during the dictatorship. This was the major condition that the military demanded in return for allowing the country to be returned to civilian rule. According to the O Globo and O Estado de S \u00e3 o Paulo newspapers, President Lula had an emergency meeting with Defense Minister Jobim on Dec. 22 at the Brasilia Air Force Base, where the minister handed in the collective resignation. Lula rejected their resignations and promised to stop the proposed bill from being sent to Congress. According to press reports, the president claimed he was not aware of some of the provisions of the new bill. The mentor and coordinator of the proposed National Human Rights Program is Lula\u2019s own Minister of the Secretariat of Human Rights Paulo Vannuchi. According to the Estado de S \u00e3 o Paulo paper , the military was extremely alarmed that the proposed reappraisal of human rights abuses during the military dictatorship mentioned only state actors, and did not include the various armed, left-wing guerilla groups that kidnapped, killed and robbed during that same period. \u201cIf they want to put a colonel or a general in the defendant\u2019s seat, then let\u2019s also put Dilma and Franklin Martins there,\u201d one active general told the newspaper. He was referring to Lula\u2019s chief of cabinet Dilma Rouseff, who is his handpicked candidate for next year\u2019s presidential elections, and the head of government communications, both of whom participated in armed struggle against the military dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. It is obvious that Lula, the first left-wing president that Brazil has had since Jo\u00e3o Goulart was overthrown in 1964, is pushing the envelope on abuses committed during the dictatorship. He is testing the waters to see how the military will react. Their reaction was quite strong, causing Lula to backtrack and say that he and his Partido dos Trabalhadores, will not support the passage of the new law in Congress. But it is also a sad fact that the whole military dictatorship period of twenty years is hardly talked about in Brazilian schools or in public discourse. I asked several Brazilian friends if this period was studied in detail in high schools and they told me \u201cno\u201d, that it was just mentioned in general terms. Brazil is still suffering the effects of those years of dictatorship. Not talking about what happened during those dark years leaves questions unanswered and several generations of Brazilians without knowledge of crucial part of their history. A National Truth Commission, like the one set up in South Africa to deal with the aftermath of apartheid, would do a world of good to the country. Yes it would be traumatic in some cases, and yes, I think left-wing guerillas should be criticized as well, but I also think that confronting the many demons from that era would be cathartic and healing for the whole Brazilian nation. Jo\u00e3o Gabriel Vasconcellos, left, and Rafael Cardoso in a scene from Do Come\u00e7o ao Fim I WATCHED Do Come\u00e7o ao Fim , a much-awaited Brazilian film with a gay theme, on Friday night at Park Shopping, and was a little disappointed with the script and some of the acting. Directed and written by Aluisio Abranches, From Beginning to End is the love story of two half-brothers, Francisco and Thom\u00e1s, who grow up together in Rio with their mother Julieta (Julia Lemmertz) and become lovers. The first half of the film shows the two when they are six and 11 years old each. Played by Lucas Cotrin (Francisco) and Gabriel Kaufmann (Thom\u00e1s), the young actors are much more convincing and natural as the young brothers than Jo\u00e3o Gabriel Vasconcellos (who is a Ford model in real life) as the grown-up Francisco and Rafael Cardoso as the grown-up Thom\u00e1s, who come across as being too self-conscious and thus irritatingly corny. The veteran actress Lemmertz is excellent as the mother of the two boys. She notices the intimacy that develops between the two half-brothers, but does nothing to stop it. Instead she has a heart-to-heart talk with Francisco and tells him if he ever wants to talk about his feelings for his brother that she will be there to listen to him, and that he shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of his feelings. The director Abranches had trouble getting financing for the film because of its controversial theme of gay and incestuous love. Some producers offered support only if he made the two brothers heterosexual or if they became cousins in the script. He refused and was still able to get enough backing to finish the film. The director says he is not trying to raise any flags with the film, but that he only wants to tell a love story without making any judgments on it. Vasconcellos as the grown up Francisco kept laughing too much in his scenes, which I found annoying and seemed to be a byproduct of his feeling nervous and the fact that he is a neophyte actor. Lapses in the script also left me and other viewers wondering how the two brothers could live together as lovers and never seem to encounter any hostility from friends and relatives. Nevertheless, Do Come\u00e7o ao Fim is a fine film that tackles a potentially controversial subject with dignity and compassion. \u2014 The film is being shown in Brasilia at Park Shopping and at the Academia de Tenis. Mounted military police attack a lone protester on the ground in Brasilia on Wednesday. THE embattled governor of the Federal District, Jose Roberto Arruda, announced his departure from the Democratas party yesterday at a press conference during which he read from a prepared statement. He did not take any questions from the press. Accused of running a vast bribery scheme by the Federal Police, video surveillance tapes were broadcast on national television showing him and several other political allies accepting wads of cash from private companies that had been awarded lucrative contracts with the Federal District\u2019s government. Arruda\u2019s move was a strategic one to preempt his former party from meeting today to vote to throw him out. He had asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to stop the Democratas from holding that meeting, but the court ruled yesterday morning that it could not stop what was essentially an internal party matter. In his prepared statement, the governor emphasized that he was withdrawing himself from the election next year, but that he intended to stay on and finish the 2,000 projects that his government has ongoing in the Federal District, home to Brazil\u2019s capital of Brasilia. Some observers have noted that Arruda will try to hang on for dear life, but that the amount of corruption evidence against him is vast and that ultimately he will be forced to resign from the governorship. Anti-corruption activists have been holding anti-Arruda protests in Brasilia everyday this week, with the most violent one taking place on Wednesday when 600 anti-riot military police on horseback essentially attacked more than 1,500 peaceful demonstrators with their horses, billy clubs, tear gas and rubber bullets. Horrifying pictures of policemen ganging up on lone demonstrators kneeling on the ground were printed in newspapers and shown on television. Col. Jos \u00e9 Beliz \u00e1 rio Silva Filho, who was in charge of the battalion unleashed against the demonstrators, hotly defended his men\u2019s actions at a press conference on Thursday, even after video footage showed him rolling on the ground as he tussled with a protestor. \u201cDid I hurt him deliberately?\u201d he asked defensively. \u201cOur actions were perfect!\u201d The head of the military police in the Federal District, Col. Luiz Henrique Fonseca, admitted that the troops under Silva Filho\u2019s command had committed excesses in trying to contain the protesters and has opened an investigation into the incident. But he noted that initially he saw no reason to put Silva Filho on administrative leave. The Public Ministry of the Federal District took a less sanguine view of the incident, with Mauro Faria Lima, a public prosecutor, saying that it was opening its own investigation of the event by interviewing the injured protesters and the policemen involved. Lima said the military police\u2019s actions against the protesters were \u201cbestial\u201d. \u201cA protester that had fallen down was surrounded by policemen mounted on horses. The policemen threw their horses against the protester. These were shocking scenes, unworthy of a civilized country,\u201d the prosecutor said according to O Globo newspaper. \u201cWe want Arruda to resign as governor now, in December,\u201d one student protester told Globo television last night in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to wait until next year. We are going to keep protesting every day until he leaves.\u201d There are six impeachment requests currently being evaluated by the Legislative Council of the Federal District, which has 24 elected representatives. But analysts have noted that Arruda has enough allies on the council to have all impeachment requests turned down. Warning: Contains spoilers! Spanish director Pedro Almodovar\u2019s latest film, Broken Embraces , or Abra \u00e7 os Partidos , as it is called in Brazil, is not his best work. I watched the film on Sunday in Brasilia after the film opened in Brazil on Friday. Starring Penelope Cruz as Lena, a young secretary at a large company who occasionally works as a high-class escort to make some extra money, the film shows her father dying from cancer of the stomach that has metastasized. Her boss at the company, played creepily well by Jose Luis Gomez, is in fact the rich industrialist Ernesto Martel who owns the whole company. He\u2019s a lecherous old man, who jumps at the chance of helping Lena when she calls him up to ask for help in getting treatment for her ailing father. Before we know it, Lena is his lover living in luxury with him in his large mansion. But of course, ennui soon sets in and Lena goes looking for work as an actress. She visits the office of movie director Mateo Blanco played by Lluis Homar, and sparks fly. Blanco hires her for one of his films and they fast become lovers. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. All that I have just described occurs in flashbacks. At the beginning of the film, Blanco is blind and has been reduced to writing film scripts. He is taken care of by his agent Judit Garcia (Blanca Portillo) and her son Diego (Tamar Novas). A surprise visit by a certain Ray X (Ruben Ochandiano), who wants to produce a film with Blanco, sets in motion the flashbacks that tell the twisted story of what really happened between the main characters. Ray X is in fact the gay son of Ernesto Martel who wants revenge for what his father did to Blanco and Lena. Blanco turns him away and during a ten-day period when he is left in the care of Diego, tells the young man what happened so many years ago with him and Lena. It turns out that Martel agreed to finance the film that Lena was starring in as a way to keep her under his control. To find out if she is being faithful or not, Martel sends his son out with a video camera to make a documentary of the making of the film. The son trails Lena everywhere, on set and off, filming everything and handing in his daily shots to his father who watches them at night and employs a hilarious lip-reader (Lola Due \u00f1 as) to help decipher what is being said since his son\u2019s shots mysteriously have no sound. The secret affair unmasked, Lena decides to leave Martel but he pushes her down a long staircase and then drives her to a hospital for treatment. She recovers but decides to run away with Blanco to Famagusta. They stay there for a month, but Martel manages to track them down and sends his son after them. Tragically, Lena is killed when a SUV smashes into the car she\u2019s in with Blanco. The director is blinded in the accident. The problem with this film is that I could not manage to care about what was happening to the characters in the first hour of the film. Cruz is amazingly flat in this film, with a determined look on her face most of the time that just makes her look like a gold digger. Homar walks around acting like an oversexed man going through a mid-life crisis, while Portillo just seems to constantly frown throughout the movie. The only character with some semblance of sweetness and naturalness is Tamar Novas as Diego. The other problem is with the script that allows Judit Garcia to tearfully admit at the end of the film that she helped Martel track down the two lovers and even helped him re-edit Blanco\u2019s movie so that it would be a critical flop. Blanco hardly flinches at such revelations of betrayal, which was not very believable. All in all, it is sort of a relief when Lena is killed off near the end of the film, which does not say much about the quality of Cruz\u2019s acting, the direction she got from long-time friend Almodovar, or the script that they worked with. LAST Thursday, December 3, I attended the annual Christmas bazaar of the American International Club of Brasilia at the Portuguese Embassy. My mother has been a member of this club for many years, so I decided to tag along this year since I had never been before. The club was founded in 1971, when Brasilia was only 11 years old. It\u2019s original name was American Women\u2019s Club of Brasilia, but that was changed a few years ago to accommodate the husbands of diplomats who were posted to the Brazilian capital and wanted to be members of the group. The bazaar was a slightly interesting mishmash of a bake sale cum jewelry and embroidery sale. Tables were set up to display the goods of both club members and outside vendors. I bought a beautiful arrangement of tropical flowers grown right here in the Distrito Federal in Brazl\u00e2ndia for only R$15 (around $8.60). I also got a beautiful watercolor of a cashew tree for R$80 ($46) painted by Therese von Behr, a talented artist originally from Romania and who has been living in Brasilia for many years. I also won a jar of Marmite from the UK in the raffle section. Unfortunately, although I do like the saltiness of the dark brown yeast spread, I cannot eat it because it will inflame the gout I have in my left ankle. What really caught my attention though, was the Asian section of the bazaar that had steamed Chinese dumplings, Indonesian dishes and a rice, kabsa dish from Kuwait. A Brazilian man came in bearing the Kuwaiti dish. I looked in vain for a Kuwaiti woman accompanying him and later had to laugh and point out to my mom that a Brazilian maid in a well-pressed uniform was standing next to the Kuwaiti dish ready to serve anyone a plate of the good-looking dish for R$5 a pop. \u201cHow typical of Kuwaitis,\u201d I told my mom, chuckling. \u201cThey can\u2019t even be bothered to show up, instead they send their dish with a maid!\u201d With that we called it a day and left with our goodies to have lunch at the Gilberto Salam\u00e3o shopping center in the Lago Sul."}

Here's an album that should require no introduction for those of you who grew up, or reached prime headbanging age, during the grunge '90s.\n\nHoudini was The Melvins' first album for major label, Atlantic, and came out at a time when many \"alternative\" rock bands were riding the crest of the post-Nirvana wave. In fact, long-time friend of The Melvins and scene prince, Kurt Cobain shares a producer credit on the album and even lends instrumentation on two of its tracks.\n\nAmazing how these things work out, considering The Melvins were one of the originators of the heavy metal-punk hybrid that came to be known as \"the Seattle Sound\". First to wail, and among the last to get a big record deal.\n\nI listened to this album on Grooveshark the other night for what had to be the first time in over 10-12 years. Just as awesome as I remembered it, and I was surprised to find that I remembered most of the songs (I never owned a copy and was usually pulling this one out of my friends' collections). This 14 song version seems to be pulled from a Japanese CD release which includes the MC5 cover, \"Rocket Reducer No. 62\" .\n\nRather than wade through a track-by-track highlight reel, let me just assure you that this album rocks heavily and should have you banging your head in no time. You may run out of steam by the time you get to the latter part of the record, with its more difficult, noisy percussion tracks. Still, the surprising catchiness and monster riffs of Houdini's earlier tunes, along with the faithfully executed MC5 closer, may leave you wondering if it's actually legal for one band to kick so much ass."}

J is very experienced and genuinely wanted to try to understand why Sam had acted in this way so reacted to it all very calmly and properly.

Friendly to start with but became more distant as we chatted. He mentioned slapping J but could not explain why - other than he was angry at being detained. He seems angry too at seeing us get older.

Once again I will not be attending, although I recently wondered if I could have gotten a record label or PR firm to cover my airfare and bar tabs while I whore myself for whatever bands they have in attendance. On the other hand, I harbor a dislike for much \u201cindie\u201d music and can see where it may have ended up as a \u201cFear & Loathing on 6th Street\u201d type of occasion. \u201cWe were somewhere over Louisiana when the drugs began to take hold...\u201d Anyway, as you might guess, my inbox was full of notices about appearances at SXSW. Probably the majority of the bands in today\u2019s post will be there, but I can\u2019t be arsed to dig up schedules for you. If you like the band and you\u2019re going to be in Austin this week, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out.

You\u2019ll definitely want to check out that bill if they come to a town near you. The Koot Hoomi track comes from a Hall and Oates tribute album the group did.

Following a decade alongside Eddie Van Halen, anything less would have seemed as if Diamond Dave were just settling for what he could get. Instead, he dove into his solo career with a big splash, introducing to the world one of the few guitarists who could arguably out-Van Halen Eddie Van Halen. Steve Vai had, of course, been around for years before DLR brought him on board: He\u2019d been working with Frank Zappa since 1979 and was often credited on Zappa\u2019s albums as performing \u201cstunt guitar\u201d or \u201cimpossible guitar parts.\u201d Vai left as Zappa\u2019s fulltime guitar player in the early 80s, releasing a solo album and serving a short time as Yngwie Malmsteen\u2019s replacement in Alcatrazz. Then, in 1985, he made the career move that would catapult him onto rock\u2019s world stage. In an old interview with the DLR Army fansite , Vai reminisced about how he ended up joining forces with Diamond Dave. Billy Sheehan, who would play bass on Eat \u2018em and Smile , recommended Vai to Dave. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Vai said. \u201cI was in the shower, covered in soap, and a call came in: \u2018Hey, this is Dave Roth, man!\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, it's not!\u2019 He said, \u2018Yeah man, we\u2019re putting a group together.\u2019\u201d Eat \u2018em and Smile came out to mostly positive reviews. Critics agreed the album was fun in the style of the early Van Halen albums and was actually better than the slick pop rock coming from Dave\u2019s old band mates. Some even called it the \u201creal\u201d follow-up to 1984 . Shy Boy.mp3 In this age of iPods and iTunes and random singles, it\u2019s unusual to sit and listen to an entire album. This past week, though, I\u2019ve been in the mood to put on an album (OK, a CD, whatever) and listen to the whole thing. Call it random song burnout, but I\u2019ve gotten tired of hearing whatever comes up on \u201cshuffle.\u201d I want control over my musical destiny. One of the disks I listened to this weekend was AC/DC\u2019s U.S. debut, High Voltage . I specify the U.S. debut, because that\u2019s the one I have, and also because this version was actually a compilation of AC/DC\u2019s first two Australian releases, High Voltage and T.N.T . Their Aussie debut release also had a much different track list than what the rest of the world would get. The album that hit these shores in May 1976 included only two tracks from the original Australian release, with the rest of its songs being pulled from T.N.T. The track I\u2019m reaching out for today, \u201cLittle Lover,\u201d is one of the two from the original release that made it onto the international version. Typical of many AC/DC songs from this era, it\u2019s a sleazy, bluesy romp about a groupie (\u201cWhen the band said goodnight, I had to say hello\u201d). It\u2019s also one of my favorites from this album and one you probably never hear anymore. Little Lover.mp3 ~~~~~ ( Can You Go a Little Deeper is an irregularly recurring feature here wherein I resurrect old favorites, lost songs, and other things you maybe haven\u2019t heard in a while ) When I was back there in seminary school.... Oh wait, that\u2019s a different story. How about \u201cwhen I was back there in high school...\u201d ... I saw Devo make their network television debut on Saturday Night Live. Although many of my tastes were very white bread and mainstream, I was also drawn toward music that was outside of that box. In the harsh world of high school, those tastes were seldom met with approval. Such was the case when, the Monday after their October 1978 appearance on SNL, I went to school raving about this band who had quirkily covered \u201cSatisfaction\u201d and had the gall to appear dressed in yellow jumpsuits like some freaks from another planet, while preaching de-evolution. And all this just a week after the Stones themselves had graced the stage at Studio 8H. SNL was still relatively new and hip then, so everyone watched it and everyone had seen Devo and everyone hated them. Those of you who are still just a few years removed from high school will remember how fear of the unknown and different is a potent virus that pervades every school, everywhere. So of course a couple of weeks later, when I showed up at school sporting a Devo t-shirt, it was greeted with hatred and derision by the cool kids rocking their Mahogany Rush tees. tl;dr? I\u2019m posting Devo, not Mahogany Rush. This is a collection of live Devo, recorded at various venues and at various dates, from the 1978 SNL appearance through a 1988 performance of \u201cGirl U Want.\u201d Unfortunately, other than rough dates, I don\u2019t have any additional information on where the songs come from. (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction.mp3 ~ SNL, 1978 Mongoloid.mp3 ~ 1978 Uncontrollable Urge.mp3 ~ 1978 It Takes A Worried Man.mp3 ~ 1980 Gates of Steel.mp3 ~ 1980 I Saw Jesus / Through Being Cool.mp3 ~ 1981 Working In A Coalmine.mp3 ~ 1981 Smart Patrol / Jerkin\u2019 Back and Forth.mp3 ~ 1981 Patterns.mp3 ~ 1982 Girl U Want.mp3 ~ 1988 That\u2019s Good.mp3 ~ 1988 Is it too early in the day to star drinking whiskey? \u2018Cause dammit that\u2019s what Popa Chubby makes me want to do. Popa Chubby (more on the name in a bit) plays the kind of raunchy blues / rock-a-billy / old-school country that you want to hear in a bar, not sitting on the couch in your living room at 10 in the morning. Last year he released his 19th album, Vicious Country , a disk that not only showed off his talent on the guitar, but also paid tribute to the legendary music that has influenced him along the way. The album, while not attracting much mainstream attention, continued to build on the legend that is Chubby. Ted Horowitz came out of the Bronx, raised on Clapton, Hendrix, and the Stones. By the time he was in his early 20\u2019s, he had found his love for the blues, but had also found his way into occasional work with Richard Hell. Ted\u2019s first big break was winning a national blues talent search sponsored by KLON, a public radio station in Long Beach, Calif. I\u2019ve found two versions as to how Ted Horowitz became Popa Chubby. The first comes from something Chubby himself said. He was jamming one night with Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, he says, and, \u201cHe was singing a song called \u2018Popa Chubby\u2019 and he pointed at me.\u201d \u201cPopa Chubby basically means to get excited. The core of my music is about excitement. I think music should make people feel alive.\u201d The other version \u2013 unsourced, I might add, but on the Popa Chubby Wiki page \u2013 claims the name is a variation of the term \u201cpop a chubby.\u201d My guess is that, as usual, the truth is somewhere between the two versions. Popa Chubby\u2019s 20th album, The Fight Is On , is due out March 22. If you can\u2019t find it your local big box retailer (haha!), you can order it from the Popa Chubby website . In the meantime, here are a couple of things from the Vicious Country LP. The woman on vocals is Galea, Chubby\u2019s sometime bass player and longtime collaborator. Break Me Down.mp3 Satan is Real / Straight to Hell (Hank III cover).mp3 Harper Valley P.T.A. (Jeannie C. Riley cover).mp3 Right now seems as good a time as any to bring you up to speed on erstwhile Guns N\u2019 Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Of course you know Izzy left the Gunners in late 1991 to pursue other interests. He released his debut solo album, Izzy Stradlin & the Ju Ju Hounds within a short time of leaving G n\u2019 R, seemingly disappeared for six years, then released a second solo effort in 1998. The next year, Izzy released the Japan-only Ride On , followed in (relatively) quick succession by two more albums, both released on independent labels. Since then, Izzy has stuck to Internet-only releases, supported by a small but loyal fan base. His latest disk, Smoke , was released last November with no real media attention, but a lot of excitement from Izzy\u2019s fans: Comments such as \u201cSimply Izzy.... signature,\u201d and \u201cguaranteed Izzy, nothing more, nothing less,\u201d were posted on the ChopAway Website following the album\u2019s release. I haven\u2019t listened to any new Izzy Stradlin music in probably 10 years. Once in a while I\u2019ll pull out the Ju Ju Hounds disk, which I love, and give that a spin. And I\u2019ve always appreciated Izzy\u2019s serious Ron Wood influence. In fact, if memory serves, they actually did a song together many years ago. Smoke picks up where I left off with Izzy 10 years ago. He still plays bluesy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and still flaunts his Stones influence. With no industry suits breathing down his neck, Izzy is free to make the music he and his fans enjoy. Sometimes it's refreshing to hear something that hasn't changed to suit the times. Comfort Zone.mp3 To my knowledge, Smoke is available only through iTunes, although some of his older albums are on Amazon. I figure the last day of the month is as good a time as any to dump out the mailbox. Start fresh next month and all that. A lot of stuff from bands that are going to be at SXSW next month. I\u2019ll be not attending again this year, so who plays or doesn\u2019t play isn\u2019t going to much affect me. Just send me good music if you want me to post it. Kthx. I\u2019m gonna jump right in with my pick of the litter. The Pack A.D., from the home of the 2010 Winter Olympics, are a duet \u2013 guitar and drums a la Jack and Meg \u2013 and take a similar, garage/blues approach to their music. Singer Becky Black has garnered more than a few comparisons to a certain legendary 60's whiskey-throated blues shouter. I really liked this band and look forward to hearing more of their music. A couple of other things that are interesting: Patrick Bower\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Lord (of Love)\u201d has a weird, dark sound to it and made me want to hear it more than once. Moneybrother\u2019s \u201cBorn Under a Bad Sign\u201d is another of those tracks I almost passed on, but, after a couple of listens, decided to include. It\u2019s a sort of poppy, dancey, type of thing. Maybe like something from the first Killers album or something. Just know that it\u2019s not a cover of the Albert King classic. The very last song on today\u2019s list, \u201cSleepwalking,\u201d I decided to include sight unseen. That is to say, I didn\u2019t even care if the music was up to my usual rigorous standards. Everything Is Made In China, or EIMIC as their friends call them, come from Russia. When was the last time you heard a Russian pop band? Exactly. So they get a mention just for that.

So I think I\u2019ve found the problem: They need to cut out the shit in the studio. I found a couple of disks of demos and damned if even the crap songs from the later albums sound decent when they\u2019re unadorned by studio fluffery. Prime example: \u201cLiving on the Edge,\u201d which was, in my opinion, a typical late model, Aerosmith pop song. The demo shows the song stripped down and raw, before Bruce Fairburn glossed it up and turned it into mainstream mediocrity. This collection, which was probably assembled by a fan, is titled Divers Aerosmith . I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s meant to be \u201cDiver\u2019s\u201d or \u201cDiverse.\u201d Regardless, the original set had 32 songs, some of which had been released commercially, some of which had poor sound quality, and some of which just sucked (i.e. an orchestral version of \u201cCrazy\u201d). I trimmed the fat and ended up with 11 songs that I think are pretty quality. With the exception of \u201cMama Kin\u201d and \u201cWalk This Way,\u201d everything comes from Permanent Vacation or newer. And, to the best of my knowledge, nothing here has been commercially released. Bottom line: Here\u2019s yet another Aerosmith post. You know we're all still fans.

{"id": "bag-71", "label": 0, "strlabel": "m", "text": "Umami Nation: Kombu Dashi Smackdown\nJanuary 19th, 2010 \u00b7 Uncategorized\n\nposted by Dave Arnold\n\nKombu, a variety of giant kelp (seaweed), is a cornerstone of Japanese cooking. Kombu is particularly high in free glutamic acid\u2014the umami maker\u2014but its flavor is otherwise rather delicate, so it is an excellent source of MSG.  By the way, glutamic acid + sodium = MSG. (You\u2019ll get much more on MSG and umami in our upcoming post: Umami Nation: MSG the Superspice\u2014the Headache is in Your Head.)  This post is about kombu broth.\n\nSeveral types of Kombu are used in Japanese cooking.  For a discussion of kombu, I refer you to this website or this book.  We used ma kombu which was harvested\u2014as many good things are\u2014in the cold waters off Hokkaido, Japan\u2019s northernmost main island. Yuji Haraguchi of True World Foods, a premier supplier of fish and Japanese products (we buy our fish for ike-jime from them), brought us the kombu.\n\n\nMa kombu. High quality stuff from Hokkaido. Brought to us by True World Foods.\nMost traditional books will instruct you to place a piece of kombu in cold water and then heat that water until it just begins to bubble, upon which you immediately remove the kombu. But recent work in Japan has shown that optimal glutamate extraction is actually obtained by steeping kombu in 65\u00b0 C water for about an hour. Several years ago, when we first heard about temperature regulating kombu stocks, we told a group of Kaseiki chefs that they might want to use an immersion circulator. They looked at us like we had three heads (in fact we had only two). Undaunted, we vowed to thoroughly test kombu stocks in the circulator. Two and a half years later, we finally got around to it.\n\n\nSetting up the tasting.\nSetting Up the Test\nThe tests: we would make one broth traditionally, and one like the Kaiseki do\u2014by attempting to regulate water temperature to 65\u00b0 C on a typical stove.  After carefully reading the dashi sections of some our favorite books, we settled on 10 grams of kombu per liter of liquid\u2014though intuitively this seemed low to us. For a third test we would circulate the kombu in water at 65\u00b0 C.\n\nWe could think of two possible reasons the circulated broth wouldn\u2019t be as good (or better) than other techniques: 1) if the air churned in by circulation had a negative effect, or 2) if the crappy heat control of the stovetop was actually a benefit; i.e., if temperature fluctuation somehow made the stock better. To control for the air problem we added a test of some kombu circulated in a vacuum bag. It didn\u2019t take long for Nils and I to realize the bag was probably a good idea anyway, because we would get some vacuum-infusion benefits.\n\nYuji from True World also suggested we try some cold infusion, so we added a 10 gram/liter overnight infusion to our test, a 10 gram/liter overnight vacuum infusion, and a 20 gram/liter overnight vacuum infusion. We never heated these infusions with the kombu in them. As a final test, Yuji suggested we heat the regular overnight infusion in the traditional way (until bubbles start to form), with the kombu in it. We ended up with 8 different kombu broths, and we tasted them blind.\n\nWhat We Didn\u2019t Test\n\nWe didn\u2019t test a temperature range. We didn\u2019t do 60\u00b0 versus 65\u00b0 versus 70\u00b0 C. Next test.\nWe didn\u2019t test the level of free glutamate in the broth. Most literature will tell you this number is important. But we can\u2019t measure free glutamate here, and we thought it much more important to judge the broths on taste alone.\nWe didn\u2019t test the interaction of the kombu broths with other umami-producing ingredients like bonito flakes (katsuobushi) or shitake mushrooms. Bonito flakes have inosinic acid, and shitakes have guanylate, both of which act synergistically with the glutamic acid in kombu to create a lot more umami than kombu alone.\nOften a kombu is re-used to make a secondary dashi after the primary broth is made. Some of the extraction methods we used rendered the leftover kombu virtually tasteless, which would make a secondary dashi impossible.  So we didn\u2019t test secondary dashis.\nThe Results\n\n\nKombu Tasting Results. We tested three different groups (red, blue, and green), and then pitted the winners of each group against each other to figure out which kombu dashi reigned supreme. The red block tested methods of making kombu dashi at 65\u00b0 C: directly in a circulator, in a vacuum bag in a circulator, and by trying to maintain 65\u00b0 C on a stovetop. The blue block tested cold infusion techniques: in a vacuum bag at 20 grams kombu per liter, in a vacuum bag at 10 grams kombu per liter (traditional amount), and 10 grams of kombu in a liter of water without a bag. The green group pitted traditional kombu dashi--10 grams per liter started cold and just brought to the bubble and strained, versus cold infused then heated dashi also at 10g/liter without a vacuum bag.\nVacuum bagged 65\u00b0 C circulated kombu stock reigned supreme!\n\nThe verdict was decisive. Unanimous and unequivocal.\n\nIn the future, we will test vacuum bagged 65\u00b0 C kombu at 15 g/liter and at 20 g/liter, because 20g/liter won the cold infusion category.  We should also try cold-vacuum-infused-then-heated broth.  We think it would win."}

We soon agree on $50. Fortune is kind and I have the right note in my wallet \u2013 getting change would be inconceivable.\n\n\"Vam spa-seeba!\" Stony features betray a Machiavellian grin as I deposit the bill into his top drawer.

She was a straight A student and I was a solid B student. She seemed to be able to focus and get through her schoolwork easily where I struggled.   My sister ended up with her choice of any university she wanted to go to and ended up first at Harvard and then at Stanford and is now in the midst of an academic career.   I, on the other hand, was unable to get into any of my first choice universities and ended up dropping out after a few years. I was later convinced to go back to university again by a well known physicist I was working with and dropped out again after becoming disillusioned with formal education as well as my ability to pay attention and learn anything. (I also discovered the amazing community that was the Chicago nightlife scene of the late 80s.)   I think it's fair to say that the most important thing that I learned in my formal education was touch typing in junior high school and possibly the importance of camaraderie and athletics during high school wrestling.   Despite my completely dysfunctional relationship with formal learning, I've been able to learn enough to run companies, give talks and be allowed to go to some of the same conferences as my sister.   I was talking to my sister whose research focus is learning and digital media. We were discussing formal learning versus informal learning and how I probably survived because I had the privilege of having access to smart people and mentors, the support of an understanding mother, an interest driven obsessive personality and access to the Internet. I completely agree that improving formal education and lowering dropout rates is extremely important, but I wonder how many people have personalities or interests that aren't really that suited for formal education, at least in its current form.  I wonder how many people there are like me who can't engage well with formal education, but don't have the mentors or access to the Internet and end up dropping out despite having a good formal education available to them. Is there a way to support and acknowledge the importance of informal learning and allow those of us who work better in interest and self-motivated learning to do so without the social stigma and lack of support that is currently associated with dropping out of formal education?   Or... is the answer to make formal education more flexible and capable of supporting a wider spectrum of types of learning to enable people like me to \"make it through the system\"? Oddly, as my informal education has finally started to reach limits in certain areas, I find myself increasingly reaching out to formal education institutions for the rigor and depth that I need to explore my areas of interest."}

They're afraid of more demagoguery. They're afraid of upcoming elections. They're afraid of the politics of fear. But I am more and more troubled by how little they seem concerned about the worsening plight of many of America's most vulnerable families -- about how families are being broken up by the U.S. government, forcibly separating children from their parents. And for the media, immigration reform is just another looming political conflict to report, more of the gamesmanship of Washington to cover.\n\nAs always, the real stories of real people get lost in the win/lose politics of the nation's capital. Yes, the nation is going through some tremendous challenges right now. And we all know that Congress is hesitant to tackle tough issues before mid-term elections. But while politicians can write off one more piece of legislation on a packed agenda, they won't be able to write off, or ignore, a movement rooted in our faith communities. If our political leaders won't make room for the \"strangers\" among us, we will -- because Jesus commands us to do so.\n\nSignificant social change does not begin with Congress, and it doesn't happen overnight; it usually takes a movement, and it always takes courage. Sojourners has been convening, educating, and mobilizing Christians nationwide through our Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform campaign for the past three years, and we are proud to be in good company with the growing interfaith movement fighting for dignity and justice for immigrants.\n\nOn March 21, 2010, tens of thousands of supporters of immigration reform will join together in Washington, D.C. for the \"March for America: Change Takes Courage.\" In the faith community, we have amended the tagline to read \"Change Takes Courage and Faith\" because courage truly does come from our faith.\n\nChanges to our immigration system will simply not happen without both courage and faith. For many of us, faith is a catalyst to action that can solve the really big issues -- and this is one of the biggest ones we face now. People of faith will look beyond the political calculations and see this for the moral and family crisis it is. It will take people of faith to knock down the doors of Congress and bring the stories of immigrant friends, neighbors, and family members as evidence of the injustices that are experienced on a daily basis. Finally, we need faith in a God who is larger than we can imagine, the God who cries as we humans build border walls to separate ourselves from our brothers and sisters on the other side, the God of justice who isn't persuaded by the political timetables of Washington, D.C."}

Unfortunately, we both ended up frustrated. He simply couldn't handle the fact that I was not only and always happy about every aspect of motherhood. He didn't want to hear about sleep deprivation, about the numbing mindlessness of many days, about changing two dozen diapers in just 24 hours. He also didn't want to hear that I sometimes went in just to see my sleeping baby (during those rare moments when he slept) and wept with joy at his beauty.

I simply knew nothing about it, so I did not know to hope to come. I can therefore say that I am here only because yoga brought me here and for that, among a million other things, I give immense gratitude for this practice. To say this place is pretty does not begin to scratch the surface. Hvar is surrounded by the kind of blue waters that you think only Photoshop or Koolaid mix can create. The stone beaches are like bleacher seating for the beautifully tanned and Speedo-clad bodies that lie on them all day, every day. And everything smells like lavender. Hvar is famous for it\u2019s lavender products and they are sold everywhere resulting in the lingering scent that is strong enough to even win out over the sea of cigarette smoking tanners. This town is apparently THE place to be for the month of August and with no planning on my part I find myself in the heart of Europe\u2019s biggest summer beach party. Every night here is a cacophony of motor yachts humming, techno music blaring, wine glasses clinking, and street performers singing love-lorne ballads in Italian, French, Croatian or English. Part of the real beauty here is that there are islands everywhere. The vistas are dotted with tiny rocky outcrops, just big enough for a channel marker, up to large, mountainous landmasses shaped like a young child would draw a plump-petalled flower, the spaces in between the petals each, in fact, a secluded bay with safe anchorages and heavenly bath water swimming holes. The island of Hvar is the biggest one around and I wanted to do some exploring, so a few days ago I rented a car. Because it is prime season here, I was limited to only one option for a car. A first generation VW Beetle, painted in sparkly purple and adorned with gold flames and a lions head. Seriously, this was my rental. Now of course I acknowledge that this car was three decades past its prime. Anti-lock brakes, power steering, a radio, these were of course luxuries I could not expect to have but there was more missing from the standard line-up of generally expected auto accessories. Upon being given the keys I was warned by the rental guy that I should probably go straight to the gas station as \u201cthe fuel gauge doesn\u2019t work so who could know how much petrol is in the tank.\u201d While approaching the gas station I figured out that braking was not a given either. Thankfully, it was a manual and I know how to downshift, so no huge problem, however it should be noted that to engage the clutch it was helpful if you could regularly leg press 100kilos. Also, no seat belt (not a huge problem since the human Velcro effect of sweaty skin on pleather made me feel secure in my oneness with this vehicle), no roof, no way to adjust the position of the seat, which was way too close to the rally-car after-market pedals and steering wheel, and most problematically it would turn out\u2026 no lights. At the petrol station I had a momentary hesitation where I realized that this car, (and I use that term loosely) was perhaps not going to make for a fun day and that if I were wise, I would return it and reserve a real, (manufactured in this century) car for another day. Of course I put this absurd thought out of my head and headed off for points unknown. First stop Stari Grad or translated \u2013 Old Town, a well-earned name as the place was founded way back in 385 BC. Here I strolled around snapping photos of various architectural features and stopping for a perfect breakfast. I am a big fan of breakfast, in fact it is my favorite meal of the day. Back when I had a \u2018normal\u2019 life, going out with friends for a leisurely weekend breakfast was something I truly looked forward to every week. As I travel, breakfast is often my longest and largest meal of the day. So I fancy myself a bit of an expert on this building block of nutrition. In Stari Grad I had a plate of perfectly fried eggs, topped with homemade cheese and local sea salt, served with a fresh from the oven baguette and the ripest tomatoes I may have ever eaten. This breakfast masterpiece was accompanied by a perfectly crafted cappuccino and it was by far the best meal I have had here. I figured I was off to a great start and that my day would thus be assured fabulousness. There are a couple other towns near Stari Grad that I had already visited so I decided to pass them by to get into new territory on the island. The lack of braking capacity on the VW started to concern me as the road left the oceanside and started inclining rapidly. As I wound round and round and up and up I started getting a tad nervous about my return trip as this was the only road available for both the outgoing and incoming journey. Here is where my FOMS kicked in. FOMS (Fear Of Missing Something) is a term coined by my friend Bob Daniels of Durango, Colorado and it aptly describes my normal state of propulsion. So as the same little voice in my head that had though perhaps I should return this grape colored lemon of a car was saying to me \u2013 Um Rach\u2026 Do you really want to descend this mountain in second gear, relying on what little remains of this things transmission to slow your plummet to the sea? I kept crawling higher and higher, afraid I could be missing something amazing up ahead. Finally, at a vista point I saw my future, more up and therefore more steep downs to come. I gave in to better judgment and turned around. I did stay in second gear the whole time and by about the 20th switchback I figured out that the bailing wire and duct-taped lever dangling below the steering wheel was in fact the horn, which added an air of safety to my entering the blind corners. Back at sea level I decided to head west instead of south. West was less mountainous looking so it seemed a safer bet. A few kilometers in and the western road started climbing as well but soon enough I got to a tunnel, which thankfully went through, rather than over the mountains. As it turns out this tunnel was carved by a crack-pot force of, I am guessing, sugar-high Oompah Loompas. I say this because the tunnel was very short and narrow, it wound up and down as well as side to side and it was pitch black. Like, can\u2019t see your hand in front of your face, ink black. The tunnel is a one-way affair so cars queue up and wait for the entrance light to turn green gaining them entry into this very long and winding roadway. About 100 feet into the tunnel and I realized I should turn on my lights, as I fumbled with dials and levers the cars in front of me sped away leaving me with no way to see what was ahead of me, or for that matter next to me above or below me. No matter the combination of switches, levers or buttons I pressed no lights came on, not so much as a blinker. I navigated that tunnel solely on sonar and the very infrequent flickering of headlights from the SUV barreling down on me. If I could have found my purse and used my iPhone flashlight app I would have \u2013 this would have been a miracle. The 60 seconds or so that it took me to navigate that ink black birth canal of engineering mediocrity were among the most terrifying of my life. When I emerged on the other side I parked the car and got out to verify that I was still alive and that this hadn\u2019t been some rabbit hole into oblivion for me. The worst part of course, was that I would have to go back through the tunnel because again, there was only one road. This is when the novelty of the aubergine-colored bedazzled bug fully wore off. I was spent, fried, frazzled and seriously considering abandoning this thing right there at the mouth of the tunnel. I managed to pull it together enough to drive down into the next town, where again I got out to test the steadiness of my legs and to try every McGuiver trick in the book to get a light on this car to work. Finally, I figured out that if I pulled out all the buttons and simultaneously pulled the windshield wiper lever forwards and down the driving lights would work, this was confirmed by a kindly gentleman in a brand new Audi who upon confirming that I had about a 30 watt bulb to get me through the tunnel, wisely sped off to avoid the likely coming fiery crash. This is how I made my return passage, one shaky hand on the wheel and the other white-knuckled onto the lever and my dying flashlights of headlights blazing about a two foot path in front of me. When I got back on the safe side of that pit of despair I said aloud to myself \u2018I need a drink\u2019. Now this is a phrase I try to avoid using. My alcohol consumption has a long-history of binge and purge periods, a fact that at times makes me think I should reevaluate my relationship with fermented spirits. So if the word need enters into an alcohol-related conversation, especially a one-participant conversation such as this one, I see this as cause for reflection. However, in this instance, I approve 100% of the usage of this phrase and I affirm that I really did NEED a drink. Sadly, or maybe not, there was no place around to get one so I just kept driving. I abandoned my silly idea of exploring new parts of the island and went promptly to Vrboska. I had visited this amazingly charming town a few days before via the tourist bus, a safe, reliable transportation option that it irks me to say, cost me $88 less in cash, and one less of my nine lives, than the beguiling Beetle. When I had visited before it was a short trip of just about two hours and it had been limited to the city center. I took the opportunity to drive a flat road for a bit and ventured off to the beach. Now\u2019s a good time to point out that here on Hvar clothing seems to be very optional. Stores here that sell bathing suits have an over-abundance of tops and a serious shortage of bottoms, since everyone knows tops are an unnecessary accessory. Often it seems bottoms are over-kill as well. I mention this because when I found the beach it was located alongside a campground named, Kamp Nudist. You know I had to check this out. I mean if pretty much every other person is already naked, what on earth could camp nudist have to offer? The answer of course\u2026 naked activities. Naked windsurfing, speedboat rentals, vollyball, snorkeling, and bicycling. I will refrain from further comment on this delightful little quick-dry oasis, but I will make one generalization. This was the most cumulatively attractive and well-groomed group of people I have ever seen. After a few hours of de-stressing oceanside I opted to drive back to Hvar for the night giving myself plenty of daylight for the journey. I returned the car and told the rental shop proprietor of my concerns for the safety of others should he continue to rent this sparkly plum deathtrap. He took the keys, smiled from behind his twenty-something year-old eyes and simply said \u201clady, it\u2019s like 35 years old\u2026 what can you expect.\u201d I chose to let this last comment slide right by me, after all I am 36. Update: Check out the new This End Up Yoga site at www.thisendupyoga.com My teachers Sandra and Marco sent me an email a few months ago asking if I wanted to Shantisit (watch their cocker spaniel Shanti) for the month of August. I said yes before I really knew any of the details. Free rent and the lure of the Croatian coastline seemed all the incentive I needed. This has turned out to be another one of those times, where through no planning on my part I have ended up at the perfect place at the perfect time. Shanti spends his summers on the stunningly beautiful island of Hvar on the Dalmatian coast and so it is here that we are spending our days tanning, swimming, writing and napping. Hvar is a medieval city, a fort looms above and fortress wall still surround the main part of town. All of the old world charm is still here, cobblestone streets, narrow alleyways, gated entrances, but mixed with the ancient is the new, or more specifically the Nuevo Riche. Hvar is a playground for super yachts and the Louis Vuitton beach bag-toting crowd. Everyone here is beautiful and beautifully clothed, assuming they are wearing clothes. I am surrounded by six foot-tall supermodel types and naked overly groomed men. There is definite agenda each day you are on Hvar. It begins around noon when everyone hits the beach. They all seem to be entered into some kind of competitive tan-off and try as I might, my Arian roots are betraying me. I cannot hang with the naturally olive-skinned crowd when it comes to tanning. Clothing is very optional and tan lines are almost non-existent. Late afternoon the crowds gravitate towards one of the beach-side discos for the first party of the day. From four until sunset the symphony of 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s techno pop is deafening. The Hvar vacationers are prepared for the transition from beach to dance club and they don bedazzled crepe cover ups and produce the latest shoe fashions, 4\u201d heels or gladiator sandals, from their beach bags for the occasion. The transformation is mesmerizing and could give any Broadway quick-change artist a run for their money. From sunset until 11pm I must assume that people nap and primp, because no one goes out to dinner before 10:30. Cocktail hour begins around midnight and the dance club built in the ruins of an old fortification opens around 2am. Again, I cannot hang. I feel old when I try to meet up with some of the other yoga instructors for dinner and drinks. They take pity on the grandma of the group and opt for the Hvar equivalent of the early-bird special, eating at ten. We begin cocktail hour at 11 and by 12:30 I have turned into a pumpkin sneaking away to the flat and a warm bed complete with my handsome cocker spaniel date. Even though I can\u2019t keep the late night hours I have started sleeping in later and later. For most of my trip, regardless of time zone I woke up with the sun. Here, I often sleep until nine. I wake up, take Shanti for a walk, usually down to the water for a morning swim. Then I take advantage of having a kitchen at my disposal and make myself breakfast. My afternoons are filled with tanning, exploring and writing. I have dedicated this month to writing a book proposal and so far I have been diligent, motivated and borderline obsessive in this endeavor. My teachers have a yoga space here and most nights I go to it, sometimes to lead a class but most often to take one led by their new crop of yoga teaching trainees. Getting to live and practice in their space, their energy is inspiring for me and I am loving the time on my mat. When I left France I made a statement that I would get to Croatia and get back to clean living, no cheese, no wine, no more bottomless espressos, back to my \u2018normal\u2019 asana and meditation routine, etc. No such luck. Because I never bothered to research where I was spending August, I didn\u2019t realize that I am on an island famous for its wine production and in a country whose national foods seem to mirror those of Italy and France: pasta, pizza, baguettes, formagio, gellato. And my beloved Italian-born teacher Marco of course has an Espresso machine in the flat, which I am powerless to walk past without firing up. Never one to go against local customs I have been eating pizza most days and making nightly stops at the local wine bars. I am an international ambassador for good, if not necessarily the yogi ideal. Hvar is a cultural haven as well as a hedonistic one. There are frequent outdoor concerts held in the sacristy of an ancient convent, I attended my first Sunday night, a jazz quintet. The Piazza is filled with musicians each night and local artisans set up kiosks featuring their paintings, hand made lace and lavender creations. All in all it really is pretty much heaven. The town is dripping with European charm and entertaining locals, the water marvels the most beautiful blues I have ever seen and there are no bugs. I repeat\u2026 no bugs. In the ten days I have been here I have suffered not a single mosquito bite. I may never leave. 0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false /- Style Definitions -/ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;} A student from the last retreat I did in Bali offered us her Paris flat for the week. Martina\u2019s beautiful home was the most amazing gift! To have an apartment in the city, complete with kitchen, lift and satellite feed of Le Tour, was beyond anything we could have asked for. From Martina\u2019s flat we set out daily to explore Paris\u2019 sights and gastronomical delights. Kristin only had one full day in the city before her return flight to Denver. On that day we must have covered ten miles of landmarks, the Lovre, Notre Dame, Sangre de Criste, Eiffel Tower, the Champs, on and on. The next morning at an ungodly early hour I hugged my dear friend goodbye, put her in a cab and went promptly back to bed. Two hours later I got a text. - U won\u2019t believe this. Don\u2019t have a seat on the flight \u2013 Expedia f-ed up. Next is not until Fri, so might as well stay 2 Sun. B back in 30.\u201d Well as Kristin\u2019s wise uncle once told us \u201cwhen life gives you lemons\u2026 throw them out and buy a bottle of champagne.\u201d So we did. The next day we hired a car and headed off for the Champagne region. The car was not available until 2pm, but no worry our first stop was to be a small town with Champagne in its name, just a short two-hour drive from the city, so we would be toasting by 4:30 at the latest. We arrived only to find no champagne, no grapes, no bottles, nada, only yet another cathedral which we obligingly explored. After about an hour we found our way to the tourist info office and learned that we needed to go 40 minutes back the way we had come to a town called Epernay, the home of Avenue de Champagne. When we arrived on Champagne Avenue it was already close to 7pm and all the Champagne houses were closed. Signs announcing Moet and Dom Perignon mocked us from above sealed doors. The only open bar we could find boasted Heineken umbrellas and dozens of beers on tap. Parched we found a wine store and bought a split to wet our whistles. We walked into the center of town and popped the cork. I went to lift the bottle to my lips when I spied a man staring at me with a look of absolute horror. He came over and told us that it was unacceptable to drink like this and told us to stay put for a moment. Unsure if I was about to be arrested for public consumption I waited. Henri returned with two champagne glasses from his flat. He gave them to us to keep as a souvenir and made us promise to never again defile his country\u2019s nectar of the gods in such a hedonistic manner. We promised. The ensuing hours we my absolute favorite in France. Our car plodded on back to Paris and along the way we visited a local winemaker's house bought three bottles and kept going. At the most beautiful part of the evening we stopped at a solitary church and cemetery where we took hundreds of soft-lighted photos of ancient headstones backed by vineyards of champagne grapes. The past and the future intrinsically entertained. Those who originally planted the vines, now resting among them for eternity. It was a truly amazing day and one I will not soon forget. Over the course of the next few days we visited Versaille, the Grande Palace, the Petit Palace, more cathedrals, more landmarks, retail stores we could not afford, bistros we barely could and then we took a whole day to stay indoors, watch the Tour and an entire HBO series. That day was fantastic too. While it may seem wasteful to while away a whole Parisian day indoors, the truth was we were beat. Saturday we moved to Roberto\u2019s hotel to await his arrival. A nightcap with him and a quick sleep and it was time for Kristin to leave me for real. KR \u2013 Best. Vacation. Ever. Love you and I will celebrate with you anywhere, every year. TDF I had never even heard of road biking or the Tour until maybe ten years ago. By that time though, I was already good friends with Roberto. And so my path to Paris had already begun to unfold. We were friends for probably an entire year before I really figured out who he was to cycling fans. I remember that day vividly. Roberto and I were walking down Main Street in Durango, Colorado on our way to lunch when a nice, sane-enough-looking man in his thirties came running across the road to us, he fell to his knees and started prostrating to Roberto, all the while yelling \u201cBobke, Bobke you\u2019re the man!\u201d I stood there a bit on the bewildered side. Once prostrating man had paid his cycling penance, Roberto resumed our forward progression. I stopped and asked him to please explain. That is how I learned that my friend, neighbor and standing Thursday dinner date was kind of famous. This revelation did little to alter our friendship, as I was not into cycling at the time and already regarded Roberto as part of the fabric of my life, pauper or prince made no matter to me. Then a year later he started commentating for the network that covers the Tour and so obligingly as one good friend wanting to support another, I upped my Comcast Cable plan to include the obscure sports channel he was working for and so began what was once a fleeting fascination and is now bordering on fanaticism. Since then, there was only one year where Roberto did not go to France to announce the race for the entire US, that year he sat on my couch in Durango and commentated the Tour, right there in my living room, for the benefit of just myself and my father who happed to be in town. I remember marveling at how he could possibly know that the white and red polka-dotted speck hundreds of feet below the helicopter camera was a cyclist much less some Eastern European man with a multi-multi-syllabic last name who was killing it up the mountains. From that day I dare say I was hooked on le Tour and even more enamored of my dear friend. Not because of \u2018who\u2019 he is to Tour fans, but because I got to see him in person doing something he is really, really good at. About five years ago Roberto started inviting me to tag along with him to France. At the time I was subjected to a woefully inadequate two weeks of vacation time per year and really couldn\u2019t envision myself here. But that all changed in 2008. I came here last year for a week and now I am sitting on a rooftop in Paris, watching the minutes tick by before my guest pass allows me access to the Champs where I will watch the final stage of the 2009 Tour. For the last three weeks I have used the, \u2018but I am going there!\u201d card to overrule the television choices of my parents, strangers in sports bars, and those hosting me in their homes. This last week in France I subjected poor Kristin to my audible rantings at the live BBC radio feed\u2019s inability to perfectly sync up with Eruo Sports TV programming and the official Tour site\u2019s live blogging. In an attempt to help her gain interest and thereby assuage my guilt from keeping her indoors, I would commentate for her. I\u2019d tell her why being number one or 21 or 51 was important, what the different jerseys signified, what category climbs were and so on. From the helicopter shots I would say things like, third one back in white\u2026 that\u2019s Hincapie he\u2019s only worn the yellow jersey once before, so he is going to give it all he\u2019s got\u2026 there he goes, or \u201c Schleck\u2019s going to go again\u2026 See told you \u201d Basically, now I acknowledge that I am a fan in the truest sense. I love this event, I honestly think it is the most amazing sporting event we have going. And my absolutely favorite part of le Tour de France happens in a few short hours. When the race is over. After the awards are doled out, each team does \u2018victory\u2019 laps around the Champs. Can you imagine what that must be like? Twenty-one days, something like 80 hours in the saddle, countless hours of preparation, strategizing, abject suffering and then whe it\u2019s all over, to be riding with your teammates, knowing what you just accomplished, cheered on by thousands\u2026 whether you are wearing the Maillot Jaune (overall winner) or the Lanterne Rouge (last place), you are a bad ass who has accomplished something only the most select few can ever dream of. And I applaud you all. As I sit for hours in different corners of the world meditating, trying to obtain single-minded focus I often think about all the other paths to Samadhi. For many, and I dare say for all of these riders, exercise, physical endurance is their path,. I can\u2019t imagine that when you are climbing up a beyond category mountain stage there is much room for the monkey mind to intrude. I can see the yoga in it, I see the Tapas the meditation and maybe that is why I so love this sport! 0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false /- Style Definitions -/ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} The Biagetti family reunion took place in a small region of Italy about two hours south of Bologna and twenty minutes from the coast. It was like stepping back into a simpler time where families ate together every night, meals lasted three hours and no one was in any hurry to move on. The Biagetti family is large in numbers and mammoth in heart. For four days we ate, we laughed and we lounged poolside at a ridiculously gorgeous villa that slept the 17 of us Americans who had come to Italy and hosted the 30 others who would stop by throughout each day. On the mornings that I was not weighed down too much by pasta, pizza or Rose, I awoke to do my practice on a patio overlooking sunflower fields and lavender bushes. It was a dream. Kristen and I have birthdays one day apart (which is a big part of why I am here at all), also her cousin Libby and I share our birthday, so with three people turning older during the week we had plenty of cause to celebrate. The villa we all stayed in is owned by a man named Ercole (Italian for Hercules) who along with being an Italian Innkeeper is a famous florist \u2013 he does the flowers for Vanity Fair\u2019s annual Oscar party among others. So on this birthday, my 36 th , Libby\u2019s 17 th and Kristin\u2019s (let\u2019s call it) 29 th , Ercole the florist to the stars decorated a heavenly confection for us girls and then he graciously provided most of the entertainment for the night. As Kristin\u2019s Aunt Lisa perhaps put it best, \"Ercole is such fun you find yourself wanting to make sure he like you.\u201d Kristin and I asked to be his floral assistants at next year\u2019s Oscars. I\u2019m afraid we might not have conveyed this desire strongly enough, but you never know where the two of us might turn up. The four days that I spent with the Biagettis were so filled with love that I can barely convey how overwhelmed I was to be with them all. Italy has always been special to me, I am a chunk Italian myself and each time I arrive in this country I feel instantly happy and grounded. This time I realized part of why that is, Italy is love, it is all heart and passion and comfort. Ciao Bella Italiano. Then we were on the move again, off to Spain, likely the only new country for me on this leg of my travels. Neither Kristin nor I had ever been to Barcelona before and what better reason to visit. Leading up to this trip Kristin was deep in planning for her time in Africa and I was moving my base from Colorado to Ohio. Because we were both so tied up with other tasks we never really did any planning beyond Italy \u2013 other than buying plane tickets. This has proven to be really fun, in that we have no expectations so when we stumble on Cathedral Sagrada Familia four blocks from our barely-researched-yet-perfect-for-us hotel, we smile and think of ourselves as leading charmed lives. Then some days we get hopelessly lost, spend a small fortune we could have avoided if we had invested in a guidebook and generally make international arses of ourselves. While in Spain we followed in the footsteps of architect Antoni Gaudi whose macabre textural style compelled us from one building to the next and finally to the surrounding the home where he lived for twenty years. Each day in Spain we would get up at some very civilized late-morning hour and then pretty much just randomly head out, blissfully unknowing of what we might stumble upon. Of course this method of travel comes with mixed levels of success. The stumbling approach led us to a market where to \u201csave money\u201d we decided to eat at a stall, which we assumed would be cheaper than a sit-down restaurant. That lunch ran us about $60, which was decidedly more than the previous day\u2019s sit-down lunch. But all-in-all the stumble approach treated us well. When you don\u2019t know what to expect\u2026 you have no expectations so you are often pleasantly surprised. One night we stumbled out way past dark. We had a beer here, a glass of vino there until finally we tripped right into a very short man who looked like he was impersonating Prince, assuming Prince ever wore red sequins and rode a flower-covered bike. Prince Jr. led us to our final bar of the night where two very drunk Irishmen bought our drinks because, exactly a year before, I had visited their home town of Letterkenny (thanks cousin Shannon for that one). High off free booze we stumbled home past street performers of every shape and size. Kristin calls them Buskers, a new term for me but one she says is widely used. Men and women laden with latex paints, oil-based makeup and non-breathing fabrics mime, mimic and dance their way to Euros from the passersby. Earlier in the day on La Ramba, a.k.a. Busker Row, I saw a man wearing just a black Speedo walking down the street, odd because there is no beach there. People were staring at him gape-mouthed and upon further review I realized his Speedo was actually a tattoo. Some quick deduction and I screamed \u201cKristin! Look at that man!\u201d upon which we began chasing after him cameras at the ready. The crowd in front began parting, women gasped, men looked dejected and once we rounded the bend we saw why. He was HUGE. I mean like\u2026 good luck finding a woman who would think that was a good time HUGE! And not only that but he was entirely tattooed \u2013 entirely! Not really sure how to segue smoothly here so I will move on to a topic not related to size but rather to eyes. I fell deeply in love with Spain, yes because it is beautiful and because Barcelona is so cosmopolitan and historic at the same time, but mainly I fell in love with Spanish men. (Elephant man mentioned above, notwithstanding.) If I love Italy because of its people\u2019s hearts, I love Spain because of its people\u2019s eyes. Tall, thin, mocha-complexioned men with hazel eyes are everywhere. I was actually uncomfortable in the pre"}

Here's a quickie blog on of one of his latest projects. From Al: Here are a few pictures of a display platter my classmates and I worked on. If you\u2019re wondering why everything appears shiny, it is because all of the food is coated in aspic (gelatin) to give the food a shine for display purposes only. It isn\u2019t meant for consumption, though you could eat it if you wanted to. I wouldn\u2019t mainly due to the gelatin. Without the gelatin, though--> ;-) In the pictures you will find a terrine, a liver pate, and a duck galantine, as well as two vegetable garnishes. There is also a beet/pickled onion salad, with an orange vinaigrette (you can\u2019t really see the vinaigrette). The single plate represents a single serving of the components contained in the platter. It took us about six hours to put five coats of aspic on every individual piece. The vegetables were individually carved and placed as well. I did the \u201cpointy\u201d rutabaga bases you see, as well as the chioggia beets (the purple ones, carved into fleurons or a crescent shape). I did the orange/white squares you see inside the circular garnish on the right side of the platter. The terrine, galantine, and liver pate were made for us by classmates and our instructor. Overall it was a lot of fun. All the attention to detail I learned while in the Army definitely pays off while doing things like this. - - - Looks good, Al. Now whydontcha come over here and wrangle up something for dinner? - - - Thirteen years ago, I pulled a novel from a bin at the library's used book sale and paid one dollar for it. Sapphire's Push immediately engaged me and I didn't put it down until I'd reached the last page. The book takes stylistic risks, with Precious Jones narrating her own story in a phonetically realistic voice. She is poorly dressed and obese, the sort of person many of us pass on the street and never see. Therein lies the brilliance of the novel. Push puts Claireece Precious Jones and her harrowing life squarely in front of the reader. If this was difficult and compelling to watch unfold on the page , the trailer for the movie Precious indicated it would be stunning on the screen as well. After much consideration, I decided to take my 12-year-old daughter to see Precious. \"I was really rooting for Precious,\" I said as we talked about the movie on the way home. \"Me too,\" said Jessie. I was bowled over by Gabourey Sidibe's portrayal of Precious. If possible, she realized Sapphire's vision with near perfection--as someone who is so easy to dismiss, until you really see her. Then she is impossible not to embrace. To be honest, I had some literary quibbles with the novel, but my respect for the risks it took overwhelmed them. The film has received raves as well as scathing criticism for being \"a strange combination of liberal guilt and condescension,\" which is a point well taken. I apologize that I cannot find the link now, but one of the reviews I read took issue with Precious's weight saying something to the effect of must she be so fat that her face is distorted? Then darling Howard Stern chimed in last week with his obnoxious comments about Sidibe. I was infuriated by this stupidity. Don't these morons realize that the driving force of Precious is a main character who is the antithesis of Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon? Her physical size is symbolic. It's one of the reasons she will not be denied. Whether you're on the pick or pan side of the reviews, that ambition deserves respect. As for Sidibe, I think you're beautiful, Gabourey. Now go bury the likes of Stern with a long and illustrious career. - - - I apologize in advance for this, but some things just have to be gotten through. See what I mean? Now for a random list of observations. 1. No small task keeping the cleft of venus off screen in that footage. Kudos to filmmaker Gary He. 2. Those crystals aren't going to be very jazzly after BooBoo and BamBam have a few rolls in the hay. 3. What if you lose some of those crystals? I mean really lose them? \"Um, SugarPop? The one wing of your butterfly is, like, gone.\" I think we all know just how embarrassing that's going to be. 4. I've always liked Jennifer Love Hewitt. She's not A-list or B-list. She's your A-/B+ list and I can get behind that. Hence, you can imagine my reaction when she goes on George Lopez and announces she's had some spa-person glue beads around her zorch. Who does that? 5. Regarding this exciting new phenomenon, my bud Steven Gould had this to say, \"I'm still a guy who prefers hair, uh, hairy, uh, you know. Vahaired.\" I think he's onto something with \"Vahaired.\" With all this new shit coming down the pike, we're going to need titles, categories--the whole drill. 6. I wonder if there are guys out there with beads stuck around their peckers. I wouldn't ever want to see any dickazzled or ballazzled anything. Nope, regular big hairy guys with beer for me. (Did you notice how I got right behind Steven on the New Age vocabulary job? I'm cool like that.) 7. I bet Snooki is jazzled in places Jennifer Love Hewitt can't even imagine. 8. You've probably noticed by now I'm avoiding the word \"vajazzled.\" It makes me nervous. A word like that lands in your life and boy are you stuck with it. I don't like ultimatums, so I deal with this sort of thing in my own way. Hence this post. 9. I refer to my own pudendum as Glorious Steinem. - - - \"I can\u2019t think of anything that I liked in my twenties that I would want tattooed on my body now.

Come-hither bra display at the low grade closeout store. \"Honey, springtime is high time for a new toilet.\" - - - A post chock full of writing tips for all the young writers who contact me with questions about this crazy business and craft. Last updated 3/8/10. - - - Start local and small. My first paid bit of writing was for Ohio Writer . For my 900-word book review of Judith Hemschemeyer's The Harvest , I was paid the royal sum of $10. That was in June of 2000 (you can see how the next ten years unfolded for me here ). Building a professional writing portfolio and the associated career takes time, and it sprouts from humble beginnings. If I were starting out today, I'd probably fish around for casual blogs associated with professional publications. Many daily and weekly print papers have online blogs that might not pay much, but would be an excellent place to earn a link and a bonafide publishing credential. Who knows? If an editor likes your style, it might lead to something more serious (and lucrative). Bonus tip: Leave a few comments on a blog (under your real name) that you might like to write for before querying the editor with your idea. Small local papers are often looking for writers to cover things like school board meetings and local government. These usually are paying gigs. I spent five years doing that sort of thing for The Broadview Journal . That stint earned me experience, street smarts, clips, a bit of local notoriety, and a steady paycheck. Get involved with a local literary or publishing organization. Here in Cleveland, we have The Lit, Cleveland Digital Publishing Users Group (CDPUG) , and the Cleveland Society of Professional Journalists. These types of organizations host all sorts of events, parties, and classes where you will meet professional writers and editors. If you want to be one of these people, you have to support what they do. That means buying their books, paying the club fees and having a genuine interest in their community. It means learning from them in an organic sense. This is perhaps the most important piece of advice I can offer a new writer. I'm sure there are plenty of online sources as well. Many professional journalists I know are members of Freelance Success for example. Go to the library. There you will find droves of books dedicated to publishing and writing advice. Librarians are wonderful and can always make good suggestions. In my home library, I have a shelf full of Writer's Market editions. Two other good books to start with are The First Five Pages and The Elements of Style. Mind your manners in a cold contact. Don't ask established writers for big favors. Never send them unsolicited writing to critique. Also, don't ask a writer to do your work for you. Finding the right publications to query is hard work. The question, \"Where can I publish this?\" is almost never appropriate. Get online and start researching for yourself, or go find a copy of the LMP. Follow guidelines. When you're ready to submit, follow the guidelines on the agent's or publisher's site. If there are none, a one-page query is your best bet. NEVER use cutesy fonts or graphics or anything that discredits your professionalism. Get tough. The more successful a writer is, the more rejection they've faced because they toughed it out and lived to submit another day. If you want to achieve success, you will get kicked. Hard. And repeatedly. When you get a rejection, send out another query the same day. It will help you keep your game face on. Sometimes you have to resort to Plan B and rethink your approach or your project, but giving up gets you no where. Your submission or query will likely get rejected again and again--until the one day when it gets accepted. Be warned: there is a growing trend in the publication industry wherein the powers that be simply do not respond to submissions that don't interest them. All you can do about \"passive\" rejections is keep a meticulous spreadsheet detailing all your queries with dates, names, pertinent websites, etc. Include any special notes as well. How long you wait to give up on getting a response is up to you, although sometimes an agency or publication will have response time info on their webpage. Simultaneous submissions? Again, your call. You are your own publicist. The days of the reclusive and mysterious writer sucking deeply from a Winston before his trusty Royal typewriter are gone. You must represent yourself and you must do it online. Prospective agents and publishers are busy people with no patience for ineptitude. If your information is more than a click away, you'll lose them. I recommend you maintain two types of webpage. This blog is my main active webpage. Content here is frequently updated. Here is my static/informational site. Content there does not change very often. If you are just starting out, your static page might simply include some education and contact information, and your active page may be a twitter account. However you choose to do it, you must have these things. Design, develop and shape them in a way that properly represents you and your work. They will evolve with you. They will surprise you as well. Bonus tip #1: Google Docs is a brilliant tool for creating static public webpages. Bonus tip #2: The way you drive a readership to your blog is by going to other sites that have the sort of readers you are trying to attract and leaving brilliant comments. And now for some miscellaneous links: They don't call it \"submission\" for nothing. Where I go to bellyache about writing. A whole podcast featuring Erin on Writing. Lastly, a bit of nostalgia. When I was a kid, I had a Mattel Knit Magic toy. You threaded the yarn through this squiggly little thing in the front, turned the crank, and PRESTO! a knitted tube would come out the bottom of the plastic machine. You were supposed to be able to do all sorts of things with the tubes, make groovy hats and stuffed dolls and scarves, but all I ever ended up with was a long tube, (although I did love my Knit Magic machine). When I lead discussions on writing, I often say that there is no Essay Magic machine, wherein you thread an idea in, turn a crank and watch an essay wind out from the bottom. The process I go through in order to produce a good solid piece of writing is laborious, wonderful, frustrating, difficult and satisfying. It has matured through the years. It is important to be in love with your process, to truly revel in the revelations, and savor the small victories. If you focus solely on that \"big\" publication, you risk missing the small and wonderful things that happen along the way. Write because you have something to say and your own way to say it. Write because you are driven to the craft. Above all, write because we need the good writers. We need their words and observations. We need them to scale and record the human condition. I will likely revise this page from time to time, so stop by again. And if you have good news, bad news, or your own advice to share, please do tell all in the comment section. Best of luck, Erin - - - My daughter had a tummy ache yesterday and we soothed it with many things, including a healthy dose of MTV's Liquid Television, which was one of my favorites shows of all time. We have about six hours of Liquid Television on VHS (taped in the 90s), so there was enough for this tummy ache and the next one as well. It worked perfect-as-you-please in the tape player that's still hooked up to our shitty 20\" CRT television. I swear, people, this is how you win. - - -"}

Current market conditions have created new challenges for recruiters across all industries. Recruiting strategies and sources that may have proven effective in prior years are now antiquated and less productive. The need to be cost-efficient without cutting corners and sacrificing quality of hires is a skill recruiters across the spectrum are having to master. \n \nFor most of 2009, I spent more time assessing and re-assessing the effectiveness of our overall recruiting strategy at Esurance, while ensuring that not a penny over what\u2019s necessary is spent. I\u2019m sure this hits home for many of you who either lead talent acquisition teams or play a vital part in identifying talent for your organizations. During the course of these re-assessments, I came up with the following creative ways to do more with less.  \n \nStaff Re-alignment & Re-evaluation of Best Practices\n \nThe past year provided numerous challenges as Esurance tightened its belt and worked to optimize efficiency across all departments. With some relatively simple maneuvering and fluid communication with our business leaders, we moved from a regional recruiting model to a business specialization model. The team\u2019s workload was stretched, and we were able to support a larger, broader customer base. A re-alignment and streamlining of tasks immediately followed and each recruiter now provides their internal client groups with end-to-end (full life cycle) recruiting support. This has led to faster cycle times or an average time to fill of 23 days for Esurance as a whole. \n \nJob Boards\n \nUndoubtedly, this is the most cost-consuming part of my budget. While the overall effectiveness of job boards in general is questionable in the age of social networking and talent communities, it still remains a key part of our recruitment strategy. But what do you do when you need to fill a specific or technically niche position(s) due to unanticipated turnover and have little to no more money to spend? This is where \u201cout of the box\u201d thinking is crucial.  \n \nExplore options with your Account Manager to see if unused job postings can be exchanged for other services\u2013 such as name-generation lists, source and screen, inmail or targeted email campaigns\u2013 which enable you to reach applicants with the specific experience you\u2019re looking for without having to dig deep in your pocket. \nVendor Trial Demonstrations"}

He cannot do something halfway, and doesn't understand how anyone else can, either. When he doesn't have anything to do, he goes and learns something. Like one of 5 programming languages he taught himself in the 90's. How to repair his own bike. How to build a computer. How to speak French. Extensive reading on Buddhist philosophy. Sailing in the 1800's. Sci Fi.

On our honeymoon in New Orleans, he went to every museum there was. Thankfully, we're well matched. I love that, too.\n\nHe's kind of maxed out on the academics--though I guess he could get a second PhD (don't tell him, please!) As a professor, he's constantly busy teaching, recruiting, researching, mentoring, leading a solar decathlon team, and now heading up an entirely new degree program. He's not tenure-track, but even if he was and got it, he said he wouldn't change a thing. It's who he is. The idea of taking it easy just isn't a part of his DNA. He can't not do his best. I love that about him. I love how hard he works, both for his calling's sake and for his family's sake. I love that when he believes in something, it is with every fiber of his being. I love his devotion.\n\nThis week, he figured something out. For the first time in 36+ years, he's bored.\n\nHeaven help us."}

We're all in danger of becoming soft and lazy.

Toss bales of hay into a wagon all day? Put up heavy storm windows? Isn't that work enough? Seems most of us have lost the opportunity to do hard work...and we need to replace it, at the very least, with hard exercise. Unfortunately, too many of us are too lazy to do so. It's much easier to sit and indulge ourselves with our favorite foods, while pretending anyone who suggests we do otherwise is the one with the problem --- and getting annoyed if anyone suggests that obesity is, in most cases, caused by eating too much and doing too little."}

{"id": "bag-522", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "This should be a victory lap for Islands. After all, their uniformly excellent debut resuscitated Paul Simon's Graceland as an indie pop touchstone back when Vampire Weekend were still playing in the quad. And with that album's bouncy calypso rhythms and hip-hop bursts, Jaime Thompson and Nick Thorburn (previously known by their noms de rock J'aime Tambeur and Nick Diamonds), succeeded in laying to rest the ghost of their beloved former group, the Unicorns. Since then, they have honed their breezy, buoyant sound on the road, and, despite Thompson's departure from the lineup, the Montreal-based sextet seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough, as demonstrated by moving from tiny indie label Equator to Anti-, home of such classy \"career\" acts as Nick Cave and Billy Bragg. But Arm's Way, which does away with the musical levity and genre experimentations of Return to the Sea, is much darker and more conventional than its predecessor, and not, unfortunately, to its benefit.\n\nIslands' new obsession with darkness does, however, make sense. The throughline between all of Thorburn's records (with Islands and the Unicorns) is a lyrical obsession with death in all of its forms-- from the corporal (bones) to the metaphysical (ghosts)-- so it was only a matter of time until his band tried to match its outward sound to the inner themes. Gone are the guest rappers, the acoustic nuevo-country twang, and the sunny Afro-Caribbean flourishes (though there are still a few brief flashes of them, as on chugging rocker \"J'aime Vous Voire Quitter\", which, two minutes in, implodes into a Bahamian \"La Bamba\" breakdown). In their place are theatrical string arrangements, layers of silvery, minor-key guitars, and lots of gothy synthesizers.\n\nTo be fair, almost any record would suffer by comparison to their breathless first one. These songs may be less immediately catchy, but all of them have a moment in which they break away from their straightforward guitar-rock underpinning and allow strange, spacious moments to burble up from within. On \"Creeper\", the most memorable sing-along here, it's when the stomping 80s guitar melody briefly gives way to off-kilter bursts of steel drum. On \"Abominable Snow\", a song which predates Return to the Sea, it's a winsome vocal interlude that's nestled before the final crashing chorus-- a breathy call-and-response waltz that's laid against elegant violin embellishments and delicate guitar pulses."}

I often worry this trend is becoming more and more popular; what with the ease through which we can download music these days, pretty much everyone has access to the same music as everyone else. Nothing remains personal, it's all out there and once it hits the mainstream and gets overplayed you know there's no going back. Suddenly that song that's stuck around your top 25 most played for the last 4 and a half years, is suddenly the one that makes you want to tear your hair out and fill your ears with cotton candy every time you hear it played.\n\nPerhaps there's a bonus to this though. Our natural instinct to solve problems kicks in, prompting us to ensure there's music out there that we can always keep personal. Now I don't mean we should go and kidnap awesome artists and bands, I'm talking about originality. When we dislike the way someone makes our drink what do we do? Make it ourselves: make it better. There's nothing stopping all these people who complain about the lack of less mainstream music from getting their hindquarters off of their computer chairs and going out there to make their own. Music actually is EVERYWHERE. What do we need to make it really? A little creativity, and despite how much people may disagree I think it's fair to say everyone maintains a pinch of that. Everything we say throughout the day comes from our own mouths (hopefully), we create our words. Our inner sense of who we are creates a personality for us. There is no such thing as a lack of innovation: there's another special word for that. It's just pure laziness."}

Laziness, you have been rewarded!&nbsp; The Warden is fantastic and sweet and a bit sad.&nbsp; Also, and I know that this is basting the turkey with Obvious Sauce, it is ridiculously Victorian.&nbsp; Because Septimus Harding is the warden of a hospital and the precentor of a cathedral and what are these things? Ok, I am still in the dark precentor-wise because Wikipedia is Too Much Work, but the warden of the hospital (which is not a 'hospital' like you're thinking, but more like an old-man charity house) is the guy who looks after the old mens.&nbsp; This is a bit complicated, but bear with me.&nbsp; A Benevolent Benefactor long ago set up said hospital along with a steady income.&nbsp; The income goes to maintain the hospital and feed the old mens, and whatever is left over goes to the warden.&nbsp; For reasons I don't understand (because I do not Get Economics), the income got bigger and suddenly the warden is making piles of money just for hanging out with some old mens. Which, fine.&nbsp; Except that some young reformer is all, NAY!&nbsp; Such injustice shall NOT go unprodded!&nbsp; And he starts prodding into what the Benevolent Benefactor's will actually stipulates and whether more of teh moneys should go to the old mens and whether the warden is living off of ill-gotten gains and then the warden starts wondering if he is living off of ill-gotten gains and did I mention that the young reformer and the warden's daughter ARE IN LOVE!?!?!&nbsp; Conflict!! So the warden is trying to figure out if he's doing a bad thing and the reformer is trying to figure out how to maintain the good opinion of his lady-love while prosecuting the hell out of her papa and the warden's son-in-law is trying to strong-arm the warden into standing up for his rights and then the press gets involved and everyone is quite overwrought. And that's sort of the whole of it.&nbsp;It is super. Cross-posted at books i done read. I think I liked the idea of this book more than the book itself. A gothic mystery/horror story set in Victorian London, featuring Charles Dickens and narrated by Wilkie Collins sounded like exactly the kind of book I would enjoy. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to its fascinating premise and I was left with mixed feelings about it. Drood is told in the form of a memoir written by Wilkie Collins (a close friend and collaborator of Charles Dickens, as well as being the author of The Woman in White, The Moonstone and many other novels and plays) and addressed to an unknown reader in the future \u2013 that is, to us. The story begins with the Staplehurst Rail Disaster of 1865, when the train on which Charles Dickens is travelling crashes, sending most of the carriages plummeting over a viaduct into the riverbed below. Luckily Dickens is in one of the few carriages that doesn't fall. As he helps to rescue people from the wreckage, he encounters a mysterious figure dressed in a black cape who introduces himself only as 'Drood'. In the days following the train crash, Dickens becomes obsessed with finding Drood and discovering his true identity. With the reluctant help of Wilkie Collins, Dickens begins a search for Drood which leads them through the dark alleys and underground catacombs of London. Interspersed with the Drood storyline are long passages in which we learn about the family life and living arrangements of both Dickens and Collins, how much they earned for their various novels, their walking tour of Cumberland in 1857, the details of Wilkie's laudanum addiction, the story of the Swiss chalet given to Dickens by his friend Charles Fechter, Dickens' interest in mesmerism and every other piece of biographical information you could possibly want to know. Simmons also incorporates some genuine historical letters and quotes which adds some authenticity to the book. I can see why some readers might find this boring, but I enjoyed these sections \u2013 I thought the descriptions of Dickens' reading tours were particularly fascinating. Simmons has attempted to imitate Wilkie Collins' narrative style (including the Victorian habit of talking directly to the reader) but I felt that he didn't get it quite right. He also uses a lot of words and phrases that just sound either too modern or too American to me (the real Collins or Dickens would have walked on the pavement rather than the sidewalk, for example). This is only a small complaint though, as overall, Dear Reader, I thought his style was quite convincing. I do like the way the book takes us through the process of researching and writing The Moonstone . However, some important plot points are given away so if you haven\u2019t already read The Moonstone and think you might want to, then I would suggest you read it before you begin Drood. It might also be a good idea to read The Mystery of Edwin Drood first (I didn't and kept wishing I had). Another thing I liked about the book was the way Simmons deliberately tries to confuse and mislead the reader - at several points in the novel we are made to wonder whether something we've just read is real or an illusion. This journey through the cemeteries, opium dens and underground sewers of London is a good atmospheric read for a cold dark night, but I was slightly disappointed by it and despite reading all 775 pages I still can't decide whether I enjoyed it or not! However, it will almost certainly leave you wanting to learn more about Dickens and Collins and their works, which can only be a good thing. If you like this type of book I would also recommend The Quincunx by Charles Palliser - another book set in Victorian England and written in a 19th century style. Before I come to the end of this review I would just like to say a few words in defence of poor Wilkie Collins, who happens to be one of my favourite authors. Simmons clearly doesn't rate Wilkie as a writer (I saw an interview where he described him as 'mediocre') and in Drood , the character is portrayed as a not very talented, second-rate author who is consumed with jealousy of the more successful Dickens and becomes increasingly bitter and unlikeable as the book goes on. I admit I'm biased because I've absolutely loved every Wilkie Collins book I've read; he was a much better writer than Drood suggests and definitely not mediocre, at least in my opinion! -Pictures of Charles Dickens (top) and Wilkie Collins (bottom) both in the public domain Helen Loves Books The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&nbsp; by Anne Bronte (1848-409 pages) The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the second and last&nbsp; novel written by Anne Bronte in her twenty nine years (1820 to 1849). &nbsp;&nbsp; Last month I read and posted on her first work, Agnes Grey. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is told in a very interesting way. &nbsp;&nbsp; It is a novel very rooted in its time and place. &nbsp;&nbsp; The book is divided into three sections and each is told from a different point of view and narrated in a different fashion. &nbsp; Part One is from the point of view of Gilbert, a well off farmer. &nbsp; A mysterious woman, a widow and her son, have moved into Wildfell Hall, a once grand mansion. &nbsp;&nbsp; Gilbert begins to court the widow, Helen Graham and loses interest in the woman his mother wanted him to marry. &nbsp; In a search for revenge, this woman begins to spread gossip about Helen. &nbsp; &nbsp; One needs to keep in mind that in the time and place of the novel a woman was not thought complete without a man and any single woman, widow or otherwise, above the age of twenty five or so was seen as a potential threat to the stability of the community and its morals. &nbsp;&nbsp; A friend of Gilbert's is also seemingly courting Helen. &nbsp; When Gilbert behaves in a jealous fashion, Helen gives Gilbert her diaries to read. The diary reveals her abusive marriage to Arthur Huntington. &nbsp;&nbsp; Helen begins the marriage completely in love. &nbsp; Over time Arthur seems to become bored with her company and prefers to spend his time with friends from his days prior to marriage. &nbsp; These friends lead him back into a life of heavy drinking and partying with women of dubious repute in the company of male friends. &nbsp; He becomes abusive to her and he tries to turn her son to his ways, teaching him to disrespect his mother and use improper language. &nbsp; In a move of extreme boldness for her day, Helen left Arthur. &nbsp;&nbsp; There some interesting twists and turns of the plot and throughout it all Helen behaves in a near saintly fashion, returning to her abusive husband to nurse him&nbsp; through a fatal disease. Part 3 begins when Helen leaves Wildfell Hall. &nbsp; We see Anne has kept some secrets from us. &nbsp; &nbsp; The ending is much like the ending of Agnes Grey . &nbsp; I liked several things about this book. &nbsp; I liked Anne Bronte's use of differing narrative modes for different sections of the book. &nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed the conversations in the book a lot. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wildfell Hall shows Anne was rapidly developing as an artist, compared with her first work. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wildfell Hall is one of the first novels showing a woman leaving an abusive husband. &nbsp; &nbsp; The abusive husband is a bit of a stereotype of the times (hence the name Huntington meaning he prefers the pleasure of the hunt to the company of his wife). &nbsp;&nbsp; You can see how deeply Anne felt alcohol was at the root of the problems in her marriage. &nbsp; She was very unhappy when her husband began to teach their son to drink. &nbsp;&nbsp; The novel is rooted in the time as there is no longer any great mysterious stigma that attached to a single woman with a child as there was in England in the 1840s.&nbsp; (Or perhaps one should say a single woman not of the poorer and majority class of people.) &nbsp; &nbsp; The world of women is a small one in the novels of Anne Bronte. &nbsp; She explores its limits very well. I read Wildfell Hall in part because I have decided to read all of the novels of the Bronte Sisters. &nbsp; There are only seven of them and I like feeling closure on a reading project. &nbsp;&nbsp; As I was reading I could not help but wonder if almost everyone reads her works mainly because of who her ates were . &nbsp; (\"Ate\" is a tagalog word for \"big sister\" that conveys for me the familial relationship between Anne and her sisters. &nbsp;&nbsp; A young sister or brother will call&nbsp; their older&nbsp; sibling \"Ate Jane\" and it is meant to convey respect for an elder sister.) &nbsp; &nbsp; Wildfell Hall is worth reading on its own. &nbsp;&nbsp; Her work does not have the power, depth and beauty of&nbsp; the work of her ates but not much does. &nbsp;&nbsp; I really thing anyone into the Brontes, the Victorian novel or 19th century women writers should read all of&nbsp; the Bronte novels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mel u The Reading Life &nbsp; click on poster for link to trailer Corey and I had a date night tonight to go see the new Alice in Wonderland movie. We saw in 3D. Alice is 19 years old and has dreams about the happenings of the original movies.... My thoughts are....... that it was just okay. We will not be taking the kids to see it at the theater. First and foremost, I think they would be bored. The beginning is very slow to get going and the plot would kind of be over their heads I think with her being rebellious about corsets and stockings, and then attending a party that turns out to be her engagement party. That doesn't ruin the plot I don't think. She eventually chases after the white rabbit and falls in the rabbit hole...etc., etc. It was very much like the movies I have seen before..just different looking. The plot is a little different but several of the same things happen, but with less \"childishness\" about them. My conclusion is that...it wasn't serious and deep enough to make it very interesting for adults, but it wasn't childish and silly enough to make it fully appropriate for children either. The gruesome aspects (stepping on human heads to cross a moat, monster eyes being plucked out by straight pins) make it just too much for little kids, so then the lack of more makes it slightly too simple for adults. I think it should have gone one more step one way or the other. It does look very interesting and beautiful. The 3D affects are great. There are some really funny parts with the Red Queen when she goes on her tirades, but I don't think kids would \"get it.\" The March Hare is pretty funny. The Mad Hatter is typical of what you would expect with Johnny Depp playing that part. The White Queen is whimsical. There is a good message of good conquering evil and the Red Queen's demise. I even picked up on some easy to make comparisons between the overall story/characters/storyline and Christianity. Overall...if I were rating on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being Mystery Science Theater level and 10 being like Epic Life Changing Films...I would give it a ....... 6. I would watch it again maybe, the story is good because the story was already good, but it will be hard to find the just right age for our kids so we can watch it together as a family. Better versions of this movie have already been made, in my opinion the Disney one is the best because it makes me laugh a lot! Even though they said it is not supposed to be \"the original movie\" it kind of is. A good version, but disappointed because it could have been so much better. I think the fault lies with whoever wrote the screenplay. This movie completes my Victorian Film Mini-Movie Challenge. I didn't even realize it until I was posting on my other blog and saw the list of what I had already completed. Although most of this film is NOT set in the regular Victorian setting, it is for part of the time and the essence is there, even in Wonderland, or \"Underland\" as it is called in this film. Ok so, I read this a long time ago before I understood things like 'subtlety' and I was all, What?&nbsp; This isn't scary.&nbsp; Those ghosts probably aren't even real. But now ACK!&nbsp; Those ghosts probably aren't even real!!! So a bunch of people are sitting around telling ghost stories over Christmas (you know, as one does ) and this one guy is all, I have a story that will chill you!&nbsp; But it's at home and I have to send for it, so you can all go ahead and wait.&nbsp; And that's how tenterhooks were born. The story finally arrives and he reads it and its this governess who takes a position looking after two wee chillens who are beautiful and perfect and good and innocent (which is sort of freaky on its own, no?) except that maybe they are communicating with and/or possessed by some wicked ghosts.&nbsp; Because the governess keeps seeing said ghosts, who are apparently the valet and the previous governess (who got knocked up by said valet and drowned herself in the lake [allegedly]), and they appear to be trying to get the children.&nbsp; Except that whenever the ghosts appear, the children make a POINT of REALLY DELIBERATELY not seeing them, even though the governess is sure they do.&nbsp; It's pretty sinister. But then also maybe the children really don't see the ghosts because there are no ghosts because the governess is going mad?&nbsp; Because maybe they make a point of really deliberately not seeing them because they actually don't see them because&nbsp; they aren't there ?!?!?&nbsp; And the housekeeper doesn't seem them, even when they're right there but maybe she just doesn't have that ability?&nbsp; And I realize that I'm not making this sound very scary and loads of people read TotS and don't stay up nights but few things&nbsp;terrify my shit more&nbsp;than ambiguity.&nbsp; Except maybe sharks. I also feel like I should shoot you a disclaimer here and let you know that James is a mad&nbsp;over-commafier and no one thought to&nbsp;pelt him with&nbsp;periods, so his sentences get rull long and Victorian.&nbsp; Not like Lisa Appignanesi's do , to the point where you totally lose track of where the sentence started, but enough to exhaust the old temporal lobe.&nbsp; But I find him Worth It. Cross-posted at books i done read . Montmorency is a thief. A common criminal, doing time in one of Victorian London's notorious prison in 1875. But what makes him a different than many criminals is that he's very smart, and that he is lucky enough to have a benefactor of sorts -- a brilliant doctor who saved his life. While fleeing the police after a robbery attempt, Montmorency he crashed through a factory skylight and landed on an enormous machine, and would have died from his injuries if an ambitious young doctor hadn't wanted to use him as a test case. A year after his accident, following multiple painful surgeries, the thief who is known as Montmorency (an alias he has adopted, from the name on the bag of tools he was clutching as he fell) is routinely trotted out for meetings of the Victorian scientific community. He's prodded and poked like a laboratory animal, while the upper-crusties are treating him like some kind of rare zoo exhibit, Montmorency, a bright young man with an excellent memory, is actually studying them, and storing away all sorts of useful information. He's not stealing valuables items any more -- just valuable ideas.&nbsp; After one such exhibition, Montmorency absorbs up a very interesting piece of information: a map of the newly renovated London sewer system. Montmorency realizes that this would be the perfect escape route for a thief, and for the rest of his incarceration, he begins planning. He will use his burglary skills and newfound knowledge to reinvent himself as a gentleman. I really enjoyed this book. Of course, I'm currently fascinated by the Victorian period, but this book was both well-written historical novel and an exciting adventure/crime story. Though I personally would never have the nerve to burglarize, it's fun to imagine -- I do love heist movies and crime capers, so there you go. I think Upland did a good job imagining any plot holes and figuring out plausible explanations as to how Montmorency is able to pull off a double life as a Victorian gentleman (a trick in itself) and a thief that spends his nights in the slimy sewers of London without getting caught. He does encounter all kinds of setbacks and dangers. I do wish that Updale had given more details about the actual burglaries -- once it's established that he's a thief, she doesn't give many examples of the crimes, just the fact that he's a burglar. Also, she doesn't flesh out too much of his character -- Montmorency is so busy trying to reinvent himself, yet the reader learns next to nothing about his history, not even his real name. A little more detail would have been great. Since this is the first in the series of four, I suspect the reader will get more information in the later volumes. While I do recommend Montmorency , I have to point out that there is extensive discussion, especially in the beginning, about the filth of the London sewer system and everything that's in there -- and fairly explicit descriptions of the sanitation systems of Victorian prisons. If you have a weak stomach, you might want to skim those chapters. I like to read while I eat, but I would not recommend this book for mealtime&nbsp;reading until you get past about Chapter 13. It's short, only 233 pages, and a fast read. This volume of the Montmorency series is also available on audiobook, narrated by the wonderful Stephen Fry (aka Wooster from PBS' Jeeves &amp; Wooster). I've already put Monmorency Book #2 on hold at the library. Sadly, though there are several copies of the first book in my library system (which has 24 branches) they only own one of each of the remaining books in the series. It's too bad this book isn't more popular.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe if all the teens read it, they'll get hooked on Victorians and we'll have a whole new generation of lit lovers. This is book #4 for Our Mutual Read challenge. In some ways, this reminds me of Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky which is another instance in which the story behind a book is just as interesting as the book itself. My first online search for information about The Bondwoman's Narrative pulled up not information about the narrative itself, but an outline of events about Henry Louis Gates Jr's discovery and analysis of the manuscript, the proposed theories surrounding its authorship by Hannah Crafts (a pseudonym), and its journey to publication. Which admittedly is fascinating. I'd been unsure whether to include this Virago Modern Classic in this month's reading, but the story behind the story cinched the deal for me. As fascinating as it is, however, I became more interested in the story behind the story and almost forgot about the narrative itself; there are about a hundred pages of text before the novel begins and the introduction is engaging, but in its efforts to illuminate the various possible identities for Hannah Crafts, much of the story's plot is revealed along with abundant information about the actions of the characters therein. I would have preferred the introduction be presented as an appendix (but this is a pet peeve of mine, being so spoiler-phobic, and simultaneously being an orderly reader who would prefer to begin at the beginning and read straight through); but, the appendices are filled with their own interesting information (e.g. detailed description of how the manuscript was authenticated) so there wasn't much room there for more, I'd guess. So I read about 20 pages of the Introduction and then I jumped ahead to read the novel, and I jumped back to the Introduction when I had finished Hannah Craft's novel. butButBUT...the backstory is gripping and vital, contextually, to a more complete understanding of The Bondwoman's Narrative , so I am not actually complaining about this (even if it kinda sounds that way). Here's the thing though: forget about all the history behind it for a second... The Bondwoman's Narrative is a gripping tale. Apparently the author was heavily influenced by books like Bleak House and Jane Eyre (I've only read Jane Eyre of those two, but I'm not sure I would have spotted the connections, although scholars have pointed out many direct similarities between TBW'sN and these two texts) and there are all kinds of creepy and dramatic events that pull the reader into the story. A hatchet with hair still stuck to the heft, trees haunted by spirits still furious at their unjust treatment while alive, women driven mad, conniving business dealings (and, yes, this includes the business of human trade): this is not a dry, historical narrative, but a fantastic yarn. Nonetheless, a yarn with considerable import. As potentially the first known novel written by an African American woman, this novel is significant for being one of few of that time period that took the author's race as the norm. Unlike other narratives of that time period, which were sometimes even written under pseudonyms by white women pretending to write an \"escape-from-slavery\" chronicle (true abolitionists or simply opportunists who envied Harriet Beecher Stowe's incredible success with her 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin ), the black characters in The Bondwoman's Narrative are never described in stereotypical terms and the presumption is that characters are black, unless otherwise described. This is the exception rather than the rule for manuscripts dating to this time period, so it's certainly possible to read this novel for scholarly reasons, but too much emphasis on its importance might discourage readers who, if they just approached this as a 19th-Century Sentimental novel, might just find it a good read. Surely a book can be both: important and enjoyable. Anyone else read something lately that they were surprised to find themselves truly enjoying, even though they might have originally chosen the book because it was culturally or historically significant? I am running out of cliches to express how much Sarah Waters rocks me like a hurricane.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; She is amazeballs.&nbsp; When she is good, she is very, very good and when she is bad, she is still pretty damned good.&nbsp; Admit it, The Night Watch only kind of sucked because it wasn't Fingersmith . And to be fair, Affinity ?&nbsp; Also not Fingersmith .&nbsp; Ok but come on, you guys.&nbsp; SPIRIT MEDIUMS and SECRETS and spinster ladies who are recovering from the deaths of their fathers and then also something else horrible that they're not telling you about and also VICTORIAN LADY PRISONS.&nbsp; You would like read. Ok so.&nbsp; Margaret is a spinster lady who is visiting women in prison because that is the sort of benevolent thing ladies did in those days, to guide them in the ways of not being felons, and also&nbsp;so that the benevolent ladies didn't go stark raving mad while living at home with their mothers and being spinsters.&nbsp; Also, something horrible happened to her and no one is talking about it but everyone is mentioning it obliquely and&nbsp;glancing significantly at everyone else.&nbsp; Prepare to feel out of the loop. But then Margaret meets Selina, prisoner-slash-spirit-medium, and if you are at all familiar with La Waters you will be all I SEE YOU COMING, LADY ROMANCE!&nbsp; And if you are not, well, you have eyes.&nbsp; And I really want other things to have happened so that I can delineate them for you, but for the rest of the novel Margaret goes to visit Selina in prison and that is sort of it for&nbsp; many, many pages &nbsp;then something Fairly Unexpected happens at the end.&nbsp; So. And it is awesome and atmsopheric and there may or may not be spooks.&nbsp; Waters can toss a word salad like she was born to it.&nbsp; I...literally have nothing else to say about this novel.&nbsp; I'm going to start just putting 'ditto' for all of my Waters reviews."}

{"id": "bag-2888", "label": 1, "strlabel": "f", "text": "I plan to stop being a public, personal, storyteller. Let me explain:&nbsp; I went to TED last month, which is a conference in Long Beach, and was asked to perform a 3 minute story in between speakers.&nbsp; I got up and told this story about Mulan learning about sex for the first time.&nbsp; I call it the Mulan-frog story (it begins with frogs\u2026)&nbsp;&nbsp; It got big laughs and even a partial standing ovation at the end.&nbsp; People really loved it and I was so high and happy afterwards.&nbsp; I'm proud that I have the skill to tell a good story and make people laugh. I have a million happy memories of being onstage and making people laugh.&nbsp; There is always a dark side however.&nbsp; I am usually telling some story that could embarrass another person or I\u2019m talking about something that irritates me about someone specific.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got home from the conference I realized that if Mulan saw my story (or a fellow student did) she could be very embarrassed.&nbsp; I was mortified and could not believe that I hadn\u2019t considered this before.&nbsp; Mulan looks good in the story \u2013 a curious, smart nine year old.&nbsp; But the whole topic is embarrassing to a girl her age.&nbsp; I was really struck deeply about what I do onstage and the fact that I have a child.&nbsp; I hated telling stories about my mother because I knew that it could be hurtful but I did it anyway because I loved getting the laugh, I loved getting to vent, and I felt I had the right somehow to talk about her onstage.&nbsp; I guess I thought there was some sort of unwritten code that made parents fair game.&nbsp; I actually feel that\u2019s true and if Mulan grows up and tells stories about me, no matter how unflattering, I will gladly accept that as her right.&nbsp; (I\u2019ll be in the front row, no \u2013 wait!&nbsp; More lovingly, I will not be anywhere near the place!) But the other way around, me telling stories about her\u2026 That\u2019s different. After much agonizing, little niggling things that I have hated for a long time about performing stories about my own life fulminated to the surface.&nbsp; I no longer wish to be so naked and bare.&nbsp; I am surprised I ever did want to do it.&nbsp; Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m glad I did.&nbsp; I am proud that I learned to craft my experiences into a story and I am proud that I learned the craft of being on-stage.&nbsp; But now, I need to stop doing it.&nbsp; I am happily married, for one thing, and it\u2019s boring and inappropriate to talk about.&nbsp; My daughter is ten and she reads my blog, (OMG!) she goes to my shows.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact we have spoken at length about the stories I tell about her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that, at ten, she is really capable of understanding the ramifications.&nbsp; Still, she says it\u2019s okay to tell the Mulan-frog story.&nbsp; But ugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don\u2019t think she really understands.&nbsp; I feel the need to protect her from myself! In some ways, this is just another example of our Internet age.&nbsp; When I started telling stories about my life, it was in a basement club in L.A. called Luna Park, in 1994, where the maximum capacity was 50 people.&nbsp; We were recording the shows, but it wasn\u2019t for mass consumption.&nbsp; What I mean is that I could speak as if it were \u201coff the record.\u201d&nbsp; This lulled me into a sense of secrecy and intimacy and allowed me to say anything no matter how raw.&nbsp; I was uncensored. But, there is no more \u201coff-the-record\u201d anymore.&nbsp; Anything can be posted online.&nbsp; Immediately.&nbsp; I think this is, on balance, good \u2013 it makes people accountable in a new and direct way.&nbsp; But for me \u2013 well let\u2019s just say I would probably never have begun telling stories about my personal life if I\u2019d thought they could be available to any interested person, instantly.&nbsp; But once I started, I got used to the open-nature of talking about my life.&nbsp; I learned to live with the downsides, the embarrassment, possibly even when it hurt or embarrassed other people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when blogging came along, it seemed like such a natural thing to do.&nbsp; Jill Sobule and I have been working for a few years now doing a show together.&nbsp; I tell about ten to fourteen stories in our show.&nbsp; (She sings songs, I tell stories)&nbsp; We have worked hard to make the show work dramatically and musically. I think we\u2019ve succeeded.&nbsp; In fact, I think our show is at least as good as any other show I\u2019ve done, maybe better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\u2019m glad I tell all those stories in our show.&nbsp; But I don\u2019t want to tell any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories that are out there, well, they\u2019re out there.&nbsp; But then\u2026 after this\u2026 well, I want to retire from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least for a while.&nbsp; Maybe forever, I dunno. We have about 12 scheduled shows for this year (2010).&nbsp; Mostly in the summertime and mostly in the Northeast and the Northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking this over with Jill, we have agreed to do those shows.&nbsp; We may actually add a show or two.&nbsp; We may also find a way to film our show in the autumn.&nbsp; But by the end of this year, I plan to stop doing this show.&nbsp; And then face 2011 not performing. I haven\u2019t written in my blog because I am always so suspicious of any type of big revelation or big announcement.&nbsp; I almost felt that if I announced that I was going to stop performing, there would inevitably be some reason not to stop it.&nbsp; I have mulled this over for the last month or so.&nbsp; And it feels good.&nbsp; It feels right. Sometimes I feel that my creativity, (and not just mine, but everyone\u2019s creativity) is like the snow on a mountaintop melting a little at a time.&nbsp; All my various outlets \u2013 performing and writing in all its manifestations -- create little rivers through which the snow can melt.&nbsp; I always liked having so many things going at once.&nbsp; I always felt that in show business, you had to have five pots on the stove just to get one of them to boil.&nbsp; I benefited from being so multi-able.&nbsp; I could do voice over and then perform at a club, I could write a monologue and then write a pilot for a TV show.&nbsp; But lately it feels that I have fragmented my focus with this policy.&nbsp; I want the snow to melt into a couple of larger rivers, not into several smaller streams.&nbsp; And so, after the TED experience, I found myself wondering what I\u2019m doing with myself.&nbsp; How am I directing my energies?&nbsp; I began to look at the darker side of telling stories about my personal life.&nbsp; The guilt, the anguish, the desire to emphasize this over that, the slant, the small or large exaggeration, the worry that someone I\u2019m talking about will see or hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I suppose you could say the tipping point was Mulan. Also, many things have changed.&nbsp; I am now more able to be isolated (having moved to the Midwest from Los Angeles) and conversely, I am now in more regular and intimate interdependence with people.&nbsp; I guess what I mean is that I have a husband and a child.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is already a lot of interaction in my life, and I have begun to crave more and more alone time.&nbsp; I desire privacy.&nbsp; I don\u2019t want my personality to be so known anymore.&nbsp; (My personality has been so slutty!&nbsp; Time to join a convent!) So, in the last few weeks I have beta-tested my new views.&nbsp; And it\u2019s already had such forceful and creative results.&nbsp; I am focusing on a couple of screenplays; with my writing partner Jim Emerson.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may or may not finish writing the memoir of my letting go of God time, \u201cMy Beautiful Loss-of-Faith Story.\u201d&nbsp; Of course, I\u2019ll do the Jill &amp; Julia shows with Jill Sobule during this year.&nbsp; Then I plan to hang up my mouth.&nbsp; I can see Jill and I doing another show, someday, but not until way into the future.&nbsp; (If she wants to!) (In ten years!)&nbsp; I do honestly have that fantasy.&nbsp; Or I can imagine that I will change in a few yea rs time and want to get back up on stage.&nbsp; Or maybe I will develop the skills to talk about things that aren\u2019t so personal and private, like many other comics do.&nbsp; That could happen.&nbsp; But I doubt it.&nbsp; And at the very least, I doubt it for the foreseeable future. Anyway, here I am making a big pronouncement, just what I didn\u2019t want to do.&nbsp; I\u2019m trying to write this in a way that appears that I\u2019m mindful of the unpredictable events that could occur.&nbsp; But insofar as I can plan ahead, and insofar as I can predict my attitude, and insofar as I have the ability to point myself towards one thing over another, I feel the plan to stop talking about myself publicly is right. So, this means that I won\u2019t be blogging about my family.&nbsp; Or really blogging at all. I am so thankful for all the people who have read my blog and commented.&nbsp; Please, if you can, come to see one of the Jill &amp; Julia Shows this year.&nbsp; For me, this show is so meaningful; it\u2019s an end of an era.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 16 years I have been getting on stage and spilling my guts while simultaneously attempting to make people laugh.&nbsp; That\u2019s a long time.&nbsp; This decision feels like a death.&nbsp; It\u2019s hard to envision myself as myself without the outlet and the drive to get onstage and talk about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it doesn\u2019t seem right to continue either.&nbsp; This decision feels inevitable and yet surprising and mostly very, very right.&nbsp; I\u2019m so excited about this, to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine me, a private person!&nbsp; (I recently joked with Jim Emerson about how I feel I was a butterfly but I\u2019m morphing into a caterpillar!) I\u2019ll be posting all the places where Jill and I have booked shows very soon.&nbsp; Thanks for reading. Botanic Gardens, Kauai Hawaii I took this pic a few years ago when Mulan and I spent Christmas with friends in Kauai. I've been thinking about Voltaire a bit. &nbsp; In our last writing session, Jim reminded me of the poem that Voltaire wrote after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 when all the priests were railing against the people themselves for being the culprit. &nbsp;The disaster occurred because of their sinfulness. &nbsp;And now, 255 years later and we still have the like of Pat Robertson and his voodoo/pact-with-the-devil/Christian belief that Haiti brought all this on itself. Here is Voltaire's poem:&nbsp; Poem on the Lisbon Disaster - Wikisource And here is a good excerpt: What crime, what sin, had those young hearts conceived That lie, bleeding and torn, on mother's breast? Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice Than London, Paris, or sunlit Madrid? In these men dance; at Lisbon yawns the abyss. Tranquil spectators of your brothers' wreck, Unmoved by this repellent dance of death, Who calmly seek the reason of such storms, Let them but lash your own security; Your tears will mingle freely with the flood. Pat Robertson is an anomaly now. &nbsp;The public is ridiculing him. &nbsp;This makes me optimistic. &nbsp;In Voltaire's time it the Catholic Church was everywhere and this was the general attitude. I really think things are changing. &nbsp;SLOWLY.&nbsp; What shocks me is that while the mainstream may mock Robertson, they don't seem to take it a step further. &nbsp;If God didn't cause the earthquake then does God cause anything? Is he a sad bystander? &nbsp;Is he able to do anything about it? &nbsp;Of course not. &nbsp;Then why believe in any God at all? &nbsp;But no one takes it that far. &nbsp;It's PC to extoll the belief that God IS there to rely on, you can cry on his shoulder, you can ask for strength. &nbsp; Why is that so acceptable? &nbsp;&nbsp; And why did the font on my blog just change? &nbsp;OH! &nbsp;I cannot stop and noodle with it, I have dinner to prepare. Val, my cat, on my desk Here is an experimental blog post - a straight-up diary of my day. So... This was my day... Got up, nudged Mulan along as she groggily got dressed for school. &nbsp; Got her breakfast and made some coffee. &nbsp;Helped her look through her homework to make sure everything was done. &nbsp;Nudged her to finish a math page and a bonus challenge homework page. &nbsp;Gave her a pre-test for her spelling quiz. &nbsp;Nudged her to get her teeth brushed and especially to floss. After she left I took the dog, Arden on a walk to Lake Michigan. &nbsp;I listened on my iphone to an audio biography about Paul Durac, a British Theoretical Physicist. &nbsp;I am convinced he had asperger syndrome only the biographer doesn't mention that. &nbsp;I get jelous of Dirac's life where everything is arranged so he can work constantly, I wish I had a Mancy (his wife's name) who made sure I was undisturbed, had food, and could take long walks. &nbsp;Today as I walk it's very deceptively icy. The sidewalks look clear but they have the thinnest layer of ice. I almost fall down a hundred times. &nbsp;I don't like the cold today. &nbsp; The lake is sad looking, a lot of dirty looking piled up snow on the edge of the lake. I look closer and see that what I thought was dirt is really sand. &nbsp;I marvel at Lake Michigan and all it's sand. Get home and Michael is completely absorbed in some lighting project at the house. &nbsp;He is a man obsessed with lighting. &nbsp;He wants to program every single light in our house so that we can stand at the door and push one button and every light we don't want on will go off. This requires a lot of work, hooking up this outlet but not that one, etc. &nbsp;He is frustrated with the software for the program and it's the third incarnation of this software he has worked with. He has been up for two nights until at least one or two a.m. working on the lighting project. &nbsp;I kid with him and say, when he gets it done I expect him to say with glee, \"Now all you have to do to turn down the lights in the family room is log onto this website on your computer, enter a certain number, and the light will automatically dim!\" &nbsp;He does not like my joke because you see, it's not really a joke. I leave and go get a mammogram. I have not had one for a few years. I, having had cervical cancer, should be more vigilant, but I have let things go. &nbsp;I get to the Evanston Medical Center and read the book I am completely absorbed in. \"Lacuna\" by Barbara Kingsolver. &nbsp;It's such a great book, a fictionalized account of a young Mexican American in the thirties who befriends Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera and Trotsky. &nbsp; I am pulled out of my reverie by a stern woman asking me to put on a gown. &nbsp;The gown is awkwardly configured so even after you tie it in the places it wants to be tied, you have to hold it closed otherwise your whole front shows as you walk down the hallway to the mammogram machine. &nbsp;The woman inside is friendly and I'm thankful for her warm hands as she manipulates my breasts this way and that. &nbsp;I think about what a weird job she has. &nbsp;I wonder if she says to people, \"I just sort of fell into it.\" &nbsp;There is no hidden meaning in that configuration of words, I just wonder if that's the phrase she'd use. As I leave we discuss the gowns. &nbsp;She agrees, they suck. I leave and take a moment to consider that I could get a bad response on my mammogram and have cancer. I fantasize what I would do if I learned I had only one year to live. &nbsp;I decide that I would just go places to look at animals and nature and the sky at night. &nbsp;I would go to the Galapagos, or Hawaii and just sit and watch. I don't need to see any more people, I've seen big cities, but I've done it. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp;Big vibrant city. &nbsp;I crave quiet and nature without people. &nbsp;I decide that I would have to pull Mulan out of school to go with me to Hawaii or the Galapagos. &nbsp;Of course Michael would have to come, he'd have to shut down his business and come. &nbsp;Jill Sobule would have to come too, as well as Jim Emerson. &nbsp;I guess there'd be some people. &nbsp; Then I think, it would be bad for Mulan to be pulled out of school right now because &nbsp;she is really doing well and loves her school. &nbsp;Then I remember this is all a fantasy. &nbsp;I blink back tears and come back to life. I go to my favorite bread store in Evanston. &nbsp;It's Friday and I get challah. &nbsp; I don't ask for challah bread . &nbsp;I used to do that. &nbsp;Then Michael told me that was like asking for Guinness beer. &nbsp;You just say Guinness, not Guinness beer, just as you just say challah. &nbsp;We like to buy challah for french toast on Sundays. &nbsp; I don't have Mulan with me but I remember while I'm at this store that this was where Mulan made her first decent pun. &nbsp;She said they should put a sign out on Fridays saying, \"Celebrate, it's Challah-Day!\" &nbsp; While I'm at the bread store I also get a turkey sandwich on their popeye bread. &nbsp;It's so good, it's worth all the points. I come home and eat my sandwich while I watch some TV footage about Haiti. I get really upset. &nbsp;I start to cry. &nbsp;It all seems so hopeless. &nbsp;What if you were stuck and had so much time before you died to know it was going to happen? &nbsp;Or worse, you didn't know if your loved ones were okay or not. &nbsp;Or even what just really happened out there. &nbsp;This is happening to someone right now. &nbsp;This makes my heart heave. I answer a few phone calls. &nbsp;I speak with a woman at Minnesota Public Radio about doing a show at the Fitzgerald theater in St. Paul in March. &nbsp;It seems like it's going to happen. &nbsp;Then I do some business paperwork, for example, I send $1000 to Sony for the rights to sing \"Is That All There Is\" in \"Letting Go of God\" for one year. Then I try to write. &nbsp;I decide my book of essays is not as important as \"My Beautiful Loss Of Faith Story\" the book i've been working on for years. I wonder if I can reach my goal of finishing it this year. I wonder how many years I've had this goal. I feel depressed. &nbsp;I remember we have no food in the house and Mulan is bringing a friend home after school. &nbsp; I go to the grocery store. &nbsp;I buy chicken noodle soup and oyster crackers for Mu and her friend to have after school. &nbsp;This is Mu's big TV day. &nbsp;She cannot watch any TV during the week, but on Friday after school it's a TV free-for-all. &nbsp;I also buy vegetables and after I come home, I quickly make a pasta sauce in the slow cooker. I run to meet Mu after school, but I am a few minutes late and she is nearly home and I end up meeting her half way. She has her friend with her. Mu got 100% on her spelling quiz and I am elated. &nbsp;I heat up the chicken soup for them. &nbsp;Nadia comes over to watch the girls because I have a hair appt. &nbsp;Michael has gone to work. &nbsp;I get my hair cut really short. I really look like a nun now. And I like it. &nbsp;I feel I am in \"A Nun's Story\" as I leave the hair salon. &nbsp;I tell myself that if my hair is going to be this short I really have to remember to wear lipstick. &nbsp;I love my hair dresser. &nbsp;She gets my hair. I come home from the salon and Michael is already home and working on his lighting project again. Mulan is upstairs in our room watching TV. &nbsp;I make everyone eat the pasta and sauce. &nbsp;It's only okay, not great. &nbsp; &nbsp;I beg everyone to watch the Netflix movie I have, \"Winged Migration.\" &nbsp;I already saw it when it came out (in 2000) but it was so great - all about various birds' migrations across the earth. &nbsp;Michael wants to work on the lighting project, Mulan wants to watch iCarly, they don't want to watch it. &nbsp;I'm too tired to do anything useful. &nbsp;I briefly decide to go read my book in the basement, but then rally and force everyone to stop what they're doing and watch \"Winged Migration.\" &nbsp;I really have to push. &nbsp;I momentarily hate everyone and wonder why I'm doing this. &nbsp; I think that if I'm going to die in a year I really must finish the screenplay that Jim Emerson and I are working on. We are having so much fun. &nbsp;Working with Jim has been one of my life's great joys. &nbsp;Just as I'm giving up on Mu and Michael they agree, yes, let's watch the movie together. &nbsp;I suddenly feel a huge surge of love for them. Before we watch the movie, we make popcorn in the microwave. &nbsp;Michael has experimented and experimented and if you take 1/4 cup of popcorn and a dab of oil and put it in a kid's paper lunch bag and staple the top, zap it for exactly 2 minutes, it turns out great. We watch. &nbsp;Michael loves the film but is skeptical about how much they doctored itto get certain types of shots. &nbsp;Mulan is rapt with the film, and so is Arden - it's the first time my dog watched most of a movie. &nbsp;But when it's over Mulan announces she's thrilled she's now let out of this horrible prison I've put her in, forcing her to watch this movie. &nbsp;Also, she announces that she will never eat a bird. Ohmygod, I love my family so much. Mulan goes to her room, Michael goes back to the lighting project, and I come in here and write about my day. Snow, snow, everywhere... And I love it. Wow. &nbsp;All those posts to the last blog entry have my head in constant conversation. &nbsp; I think the post that I've thought about the most was the one which indicated I was breaking the question down in a poor way. &nbsp;(Well, there were many posts pointing that out...) &nbsp;This one broke down the debate in a different way - between religion with supernatural claims and religion without supernatural claims. &nbsp; That is true. &nbsp;I guess I don't normally think of or remember that there are religions without supernatural claims. Buddhism is the only one I can think of. (Not all sects of Buddhism.) &nbsp; Or the Unitarian Church. To me, religion works best as a ritual keeper and community builder. &nbsp;These things are very important. &nbsp;In my observations - which are mostly about my upbringing in Spokane in the Catholic church and then watching my friends who have stayed in the church - the best thing they get from their religion is the shared rituals and community. &nbsp; These are the things that I really craved, in retrospect. &nbsp;I had mouthed the words and didn't think all that much about the readings, I liked Bach and the candles and the idea that I had stood in this same church year in and year out on one particular day that earmarked the dead of winter or the beginning of spring - saying the same things, hearing the same songs, watching kids grow up, flirting with boys, seeing who was getting married, mourning those who had died. &nbsp;All those things can be a part of a life without the supernatural. On the other hand, the supernatural specifics of what we were all supposed to believe were, in my opinion, &nbsp;a great hindrance to the development of a skeptical outlook and even general critical thinking skills. &nbsp;So, the ideas we were so benignly taught had an insidious price. &nbsp;We paid with our critical minds. &nbsp;SOME of my friends from Spokane, for example, have - in my humble opinion - undeveloped political opinions. &nbsp;Worse, they back off from any debate. &nbsp;They make ad homonym attacks. &nbsp;Tragically, some of them have no understanding of the tenants of other faiths, and even of their own faith. &nbsp;Sometimes it seems that they are even proud of their lack of information. &nbsp;Is the Church to blame? &nbsp;Hmmm... I kinda think so. &nbsp;I hate to say, I do. But the rituals and community continue to give. &nbsp;And I can see that it is a great value. I think the Unitarian Church can offer this, but not at the cost of your critical mind. But for me, I do not feel in need of the community anymore! &nbsp;I like the idea of it, but not the practicality of it. &nbsp;It involves a great deal of socializing and I feel that I am filled up with that. What I crave now, (and I am fifty, so maybe this is a natural thing to happen,) but I want less socializing and social obligation in my life. &nbsp;I crave quiet and contemplation. &nbsp;I want to learn. &nbsp;I feel I am hungry to learn and read and think, &nbsp;well, it's almost as if I had scurvy and were in need of an orange! &nbsp;And true learning and thinking take a lot of time and quiet. &nbsp;With a husband and a child, as well as a few very close friends, &nbsp;I feel I am up to my ears in interaction with people. &nbsp;Adding a church would put me over the edge. &nbsp;Even if Mulan may benefit from it, she would have an even more frazzled mother and I don't think that is good. ( I could just see myself getting caught up in it at first, volunteering for five committees, nodding \"yes!\" to the bake sale, and then being in the worst possible mood about it all for the next six months... &nbsp;Wait! This is what being at a public school is like already! &nbsp;I've so far been able to back away from most things... &nbsp;But yes, I feel guilty about it. &nbsp;Guilty or Angry? That's always my dilemma... ) I think me and my friends would have been better served by a Church that did not subscribe to supernatural beliefs. &nbsp;We would have gotten the ritual and community but not the inanity. But sometimes I wonder, would we stick to it if it didn't have a whiff of a real God on High? &nbsp; I might not have. &nbsp;It would require inculcating me about the need of community and social obligation and not about someone looking over my shoulder who could see everything. ...I wrote the above jumbled blog entry this morning and was intending all day to get back to it, reread all those wonderful posts from the last entry and rewrite it. But now it's late, and I have to fly to New York in the morning. &nbsp;So I'm just going to throw this out there. It's woefully inadequate in it's musings upon this topic. Jill Sobule and I are doing a show on Sunday night at Joe's Pub in New York and it's sold out. That is really exciting!!!! Bahai Temple, Wilmette, IL &nbsp;early Christmas morning 2009 I took this picture early this morning on my dog walk. Mulan, Michael and I opened presents, had breakfast, and then flew to L.A. &nbsp;Now I am here, and I realize how much I miss it! &nbsp;Yippity yah, five days in L.A. Not much to report, but I wrote this (below) last week and I guess I'll paste it here now... Amongst the non-believers of this world, there appears to be a split in thinking between: 1.) Those that think religion is good - regardless of truth - for some people. &nbsp;Religion is useful for those who are trying to get sober, for those who have no where to turn, for those that might not follow society's rules, for those who might not otherwise respect others, for those in complete despair, and for those that need the idea, the concept - as a new drug - to get off another one. 2.) Those who think religion and the idea of God is never good for anyone. I have always put myself in the #1 category. &nbsp; It suits me because I don't want to proclaim that seeing stark reality, which is very dark and full of potential catastrophe, is good, or possible for everyone. But this thinking is very condescending. &nbsp;It's Plato saying religion is good for the masses. &nbsp;It's Will Durant saying how religion helps to bind people together, and so for society it's good. &nbsp;It's AA using the idea of a higher power to get people to let go of another, actual drug. But #2 is so arrogant too. I mean this is all just for the rumination - religion and the idea of God is not going away and most likely never will - so this is all just blathering about the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin . &nbsp;I have always stayed away from the #2 thinking because it puts me in a position of dismissing so much in others. I am not comfortable with it. &nbsp;It's very judgey. &nbsp;Of course, that is no way to decide what you think. &nbsp;Being&nbsp; judgey &nbsp;is the point of this whole debate! But in my private thoughts, what do I really think? &nbsp;It's like a little debate between Plato and Voltaire. &nbsp;Plato did think religion was good for the masses. &nbsp;Voltaire believed religion enslaved people. Truthfully, now I'm beginning to lean towards Voltaire. I asked my husband yesterday if he thought religion did any person any good at all. &nbsp; \"Think about Anne Lamott, a nice, liberal, happy Christian, \" I said, &nbsp;\"Or people who get off drugs and alcohol because they find Jesus. &nbsp;I mean, aren't we all better off because of that transfer of the more dangerous drug to the more benign one?\" And he said, \"Maybe. But now those people are primed to follow. &nbsp;Jesus might be the idea for now, but it really could be anyone. They have made themselves programmable and basically they are sheep and now anyone could lead them - it could be to the top of a mountain or it could be off a cliff.\" Again, I am paraphrasing and adding imagery for emphasis. &nbsp;And may I remind you that I do not hang on this guy's every word, far from it! But I thought about that all day. &nbsp;I mean, I have always thought #1 was the benevolent point of view, the humble point of view, the less-judgemental and superior point of view, but actually that is wrong!! The #1 thinking is really so cynical and superior and #2 has all this faith &nbsp;in everyone to use rationality and critical thinking to get through. &nbsp; #2 is actually the humble - or no, the optimistic point of view! &nbsp;(Not that being humble or optimistic is some sort of proof for an argument!) &nbsp;But you know, neither of these words is right, it's more like empowering - it's the empowering point of view. I have not really come to any conclusions about this. &nbsp;But I'm just realizing how there is this split in thinking and I'm not sure - I vacillate between those views. Arden, in the backseat of the just-bought mini-van, as we drove from Los Angeles to Chicago, embarking a year ago today, Dec. 17, 2008. A year ago Mulan and I, after watching a moving company depart with all of our possessions, joined Michael as we drove together from California to Illinois. &nbsp;There was a huge storm which prevented us from taking the route we wished to take - through Santa Fe and instead we drove south, through Arizona and then Texas. &nbsp;It took four days. &nbsp;We had a dog in the car who wanted to kill, really truly kill and eat, the cat in the car. &nbsp;We stopped at Motel 6s, we saw billboards in Texas that proclaimed that Obama was not born in the U.S., we watched Arden pee in ice for the first time. &nbsp;It was an adventure. We arrived here just before Christmas, slept in our new house all together on sleeping bags in the master bedroom, and wandered our neighborhood thinking, \"What the hell did we just do?\" And what have I done this year? &nbsp; Adjust, be a mom who's around a lot, do a few shows, write a pilot, and empty a bunch of boxes. &nbsp;The house is still not totally organized - the basement is on it's way... &nbsp;But I am much happier here and thrilled to be in this new family. &nbsp;It really does feel like a family. &nbsp;Mulan can barely remember life before Michael. &nbsp;Last night we talked about the drive. &nbsp;For Mulan, this was our biggest adventure of all. &nbsp;She often refers to the drive and wants to do it again - with the cat and the dog. (That part was not so much fun for me.) Anyway, as I have not taken a picture the last couple of days, I thought I'd throw up that one of Arden, a year ago, on his way to his own new adventure here. What am I thinking about? &nbsp;Well, I am very sad about the healthcare \"overhaul.\" &nbsp;I am very sad about Obama and I am wondering if he is really who I thought he was. &nbsp;I read Robert Reich's and Glenn Greenwald's articles on Salon and I am just really so sad, and so disappointed, and I wish they would not vote for this deal and I like Howard Dean even more than I ever have and I hate Joe Leiberman, even though this demise is not all his doing. (Last night I overheard Mulan telling Michael, \"Mom was in the car driving and yelling, 'That Joe Leiberman!' and her fists were clenched.\") Anyway, let's change the subject. &nbsp;What other things am I thinking about? I am thinking about all the letters I have gotten from people and how much they mean to me. I want to write back everyone, and I hope to send at least a thank you. &nbsp;I am trying to just be present and take it all in. I am thinking about some of the questions that people have asked. &nbsp;Some people worry about having meaning in a world without god in it. &nbsp;I don't have the best answer for that yet (I am mulling on that one) but I remember once being at a convention with"}

What\u2019s so artistic about bricks?\u201d. I laughed & explained they were fruit cakes (while imagining the wrath of dozens of scorned cake makers, for whom I daresay the competition would be a highlight of the year). The display looked something like this. Image courtesy of James O\u2019Brien. The relaxed long weekend also gave me the opportunity to update my sadly neglected Top 100 list.  I just realised yesterday was the 2nd anniversary of my first attempt at a top 100 list. So there you go. You might notice a new little button in my sidebar. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the whole donation, buy me a beer kinda thing, but Duncan suggested it & I figured \u201cheh, why not?\u201d.

At the end of a long, frustrating day the last thing someone feels like is fending off spam emails like the ones you are sending. I just received the sixth copy of the emailed press release entitled \u201cStorm Financial a case for an Australian Pecora Commission\u201d, and all were addressed to customised condolence email addresses (which are intended to convey condolence messages to the families of deceased people).  I have come to the conclusion that you are nothing but a two bit spammer amongst the ranks of sellers of pharmaceutical products I will never have the need for and replica watches I will never buy. Furthermore these email address could only have been obtained via raking (scraping email addresses from websites). Which indicates to me one of two things. Either you are buying crap email lists from a disreputable source and couldn\u2019t care less, or you are engaging someone to obtain these on your behalf. Frankly, I don\u2019t particularly care which - the net effect is the same. SPAM. I responded as such to the fifth email you sent, but I\u2019m sure it will get lost amongst a sea of abuse."}

Kaufman, Joe Biden's longtime chief of staff who was appointed to serve out his old boss's term, was originally thought to be a Senate placeholder.\n\nBut, far from biding his time, Kaufman has emerged as one of the Senate's fiercest critics of Wall Street and a champion of the need to push for a serious rebooting of our financial system.\n\nWhen I met with Kaufman earlier today in his small, basement \"hideaway\" in the Capitol (\"it took Sen. Biden 15 years to get one of these; I was lucky to get one right away\"), the first thing I wanted to know was what had inspired his transformation from behind-the-scenes staffer to fire-breathing accidental leader. Was there a Road to Damascus moment?\n\n\"In the beginning,\" he told me, \"though I was very upset about what had happened on Wall Street, it wasn't one of my key objectives. In fact, the committees I got on were Foreign Affairs and Judiciary. But then I started reading more and more about the way the SEC was failing to curb abusive practices when it came to short selling. So I started speaking out on that... and the blogosphere really got involved, reporting what I was saying. Then people started reaching out to me: 'You think this is bad about short selling, you ought to take a look at this'... or 'you ought to take a look at that!' So we started getting all this information, and then checking it out with academics, folks from the industry, we just started building this whole repository of things that were still going on as if nothing bad had ever happened.\""}

My surgeon told me I would be \"like new\" and could again enjoy working outside, and able to do ANYTHING. I just want to mention something to the people who are thinking about having Carpal Tunnel surgery that I wish someone would have told me, primarily my surgeon. After surgery, the pain only got worse (over a 10 on pain scale) and I had not had any relief since the anesthetic wore off. Finally in July my surgeon said I have \"RSD\" aka Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. RSD is also known as CPRS Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and anyone considering having CTR surgery be aware. I have RSD/CRPS and after 1 year in physical therapy (3 x's a week)I have a 5 lb. weight restriction for life and my right hand is not operable for the severe CT still causing extreme pain. There is no cure for RSD/CRPS & it is a debilitating disease. I am no longer able to work because of the heavy pain meds I am on, and will be on for the rest of my life, not to mention everything I do exacerbates the RSD, daily tasks. If you would like more info regarding this disease that can happen to anyone go to www.rsdsa.org and you will get an idea of the hell it is to live with it. Please do some research before you agree to CTR surgery. I cannot do ANY yard work now. Any trauma causes the RSD to spread. RSD/CRPS aka Causalgia is the most painful type of chronic pain according to the McGill Pain Index today, even more painful than amputation and I live with this pain everyday. Good luck and I hope this never happens to anybody else!"}

That doesn't seem accurate. From what I know, and what I've heard from his family and friends, Mark finished the race, the long tiring marathon of the last 15 years, and he finished it well. He fought the good fight. He kept the faith. He persevered to the end. The prize is now his. He didn't lose; he won. Tomorrow I have the awesome yet sad privilege of attending the funeral of a true hero of the faith. Mark Riddering has left behind an awesome legacy.

I opened my eyes and guess who! Mr. Naughty (Billiken) . I was damn sleepy , i just ignored him and kicked him out of my bed. The next morning i wasnt even sure if Billiken's coming to my room was real or just my crazy dream. I mentioned this to my mom and she was positive that it was my dream , cause \"billiken will never walk into our rooms at night\". He repeated himself the following night too , but this time i was wide awake. I shoved him away a couple of times , to be exact 6! But he was relentless. Oh! Dash it ! it was already one thirty at night! But he wasnt planning to give up. Later that night , when my dad walked in to check on us , he found Billiken sleeping between my sister and me.

Find the free download pattern HERE at free-cross-stitch-pattern.com This cute 50's type silhouette image really caught my eye. It uses 14 count aida cloth and three colors of DMC thread. If I were stitching it I would probably not do the white stitches that are outside the design. Since it is done on white cloth, I would be lazy and skip this step. :-) Either way, 2 or 3 colors, it would be so easy to stitch up for Valentines Day ! You can find this design and pdf download HERE at Free Cross Stitch Pattern. Com. It will be in the romance category and it is called romantic dinner. I just checked Tereena Clarke's Artecy Cross Stitch and she has a beautiful free download up for grabs. I am partial to birds so naturally I really like this one, but I think you will too! It makes me want to get back to stitching! See it HERE. She also has a cute Santa so you have a whole year to do that one. Have fun. Sometimes it is difficult to take a good snapshot of something in a photo frame.&nbsp; I snapped this view of a project that I completed way back when I was learning to cross stitch.&nbsp; It is not the first, because as I said earlier on the blog that the barns were my first stitched projects.&nbsp; This may be my second one, I don't remember for sure but it is somewhere in there as one of my first. I found this chart while browsing through the magazine Classic Stitches web site. There are several pretty free charts there to download. They will be within the stitching zone drop down button across the top of the page. I found this one listed in the flowers-fruit category and thought it was pretty enough to share.

One apple a day does NOT keep the doctor away.\nWalking to the doctors it was hard not to feel giddy though (in spite of my case of the DEATH). It was so sunny and warm, flowers everywhere and I could really feel how this was it. Winter is well and truly over! Bumped in to my friend Nat, out for some fresh air with a friend. Nat was equally ill, and her friend had tonsillitis. Poor us.\nWalking back home from the doctors I spotted this book in the Childrens Bookshop in Bruntsfield. I had to stop and buy it for my own (not so) hugless Douglas. You can see part of his hairy leg in the picture above. The likeness with a fussy bear is striking.\nMy new bedding was delivered!

Since they've been allowed to advertise their latest thing on television, patients are telling their doctors what to prescribe. Generic drugs may work just as well, but we are a brand loving society. Rather than sticking with the tested (and inexpensive) generics, we push our doctors to prescribe the new drug we saw on tv last night. Not only does this encourage people to spend more money on drugs unnecessarily, it encourages the drug companies to continue developing new versions of similar drugs. I read that we haven't developed a totally new antibiotic in decades. Rather than develop a drug that will be used once, drug companies focus on new variations of drugs for long term use, because they can make money off of it. And boy, can they make money! I know that the true cost includes both the development AND production of the drug, but it seems like the companies are making a heck of a profit. If they can sell the same drug for a fraction of the cost in other countries, why can't they sell it for a reasonable price here?"}

And have you considered that you are the architect of the principles upon which your business is built?\n\nMost businesses of more than 10 employees have organizational charts, documents of policies and procedures and other ways of determining what their principles are upon which they run their enterprises.  The tiny business owner, the solo-preneur, rarely gives this much thought.  Some tiny businesses get born by a good idea and launched into activity without even a written business plan.   However, I\u2019ve said it before \u2013 if you haven\u2019t set a destination and know how you\u2019ll get there, you\u2019ll only run in circles.  Principles are important.\n\nAt its most basic, what is a business principle?  A principle?  Principles are those things and elements that represent what is desirable and positive for a business to do and they provide forward momentum.  Although principles hold within themselves policy, goals and objectives, they are actually more elemental and are meant to be the baseline governing factor in all manner of doing and operating your business.\n\nPrinciples have within them the elements of norms, rules and values and these elements all have to be defined and determined individually for each business.\n\nNorms are the \u201cwhat is normal\u201d guidelines for operations.  Kind of the \u201cthe way we\u2019ve always done things;\u201d the comfortable and the known.  Norms are the guidelines or practices you set down.

You review your business plan on a quarterly basis\u2026this is a normal function for your leadership role."}
